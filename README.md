# Reddit Flair Prediction App: An end-to-end machine leanring Project

## Background 

**What are Reddit Flairs?**

A flair is a 'tag' that can be added to threads posted on the reddit website within a sub-reddit. They help users understand the category to which the posts belong to and help readers filter specific kind of posts based on their preferences.

This is a web-app that I created which predicts which flair should be alloted to a post. You have to post the link of the reddit post in the search bar. Find the webapp [here](https://flair-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)


## Directory Structure 
I have made a flask app which is hosted on Heroku
