Please bear with me. Also using a throwaway account for privacy concerns.


This morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. The landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so I was surprised to hear him shouting.The argument was pretty one-sided though. So, I wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. 

She says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. She says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.
She says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.

A little background about my family:
We're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. Things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. They were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. My mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.
At this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and I'm 7 years old. My father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. A few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. 
My father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. She teaches Yoga as a home tutor. My mother handled things for a few years. Fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. It has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. I was aware of this and I was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand. The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which I'll be considered an employee of the company. 

Cut to the question:
I was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time.

I really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. My dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.I have a job now, and I'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from September.

I don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can I do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can I have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.",False,AskIndia,[deleted]

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk?

We also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



Things are going not as I supposed to go .


Now she have changed her mind completely.

Even now she and her mother supports the family.


No one respects her family as they are poor.


She feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering Indian society mentality.



Now she refuse to Marry me saying she would marry someone richer as I am also not in very good financial condition though I have a job in computer science field and I need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


She wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in Indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
She wants to rest and enjoy her life.


She said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


She can decide whom to marry or not and I can't put pressure on her to marry me.


She also told me that she don't want to be part of me when I am struggling.


She will marry me only if I get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both EMI and lifestyle)

11,Got struck by a cop today,150,g0ybrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0ybrw/got_struck_by_a_cop_today/,84,1586865161.0,"I was out to get some meds for my mentally and physically handicapped niece. To my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, I was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what I was doing outside, to which I stated my reason and then was asked why I was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. I was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, I decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. 

I can't help but rationlize why I was struck. My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (My friend btw, is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country). Was it right for the cop to strike me? I can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened.

Edit: Thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what I had gone through. I didn't mention this but, I am sort of new to India, I came here like last year to complete my UG, so I didn't take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised (i.e, Middle East). I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, I don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place. 

Neither do I think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as I think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first. As far as I've heard, the cops in this country are far from the best but I shouldn't judge them individually based on what I may have heard but I cannot deny what I've heard or read anyway.",False,AskIndia,"> I can't help but rationlize why I was struck.

54,"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?",9,fx71yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx71yh/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/,105,1586383578.0,"Note: I am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)

A little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

I still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**My questions are -**

1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?
4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

Please dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

And sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200B;

PS:

By intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

And I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)

Its not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn't. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.

He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

* India’s current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. Which I think is nowhere near enough. 

* United States had around 5000 cases before March 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on March 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

Even if we’re on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the Nizamuddin Dargah, hundreds of people celebrating Ram Navmi despite lockdown, Dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on April 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it’s Diwali... So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they’d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it’d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

Also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we’ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve.

Unfortunately for KumariNayak, a 63-year-old woman from the Ganjan district of Odisha, her life has been a humiliation because she has Polydactylism.

Polydactylism is a defect in the body where the person suffers from abnormal growth. In the case of Kumari, she was born with 19 toes and 12 fingers by birth. Her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names. 

Kumari said in an interview: ‘I was born with this defect and I couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‘

As she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. She feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can’t fight a long battle with superstitions. Therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.

It has now been 63 years that I have had this condition. She said in the interview, ‘The residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that I am a witch and keep away from me. They sometimes come to see my condition – but never help. ‘I am forced to stay indoors as I am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.’

One of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of Kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. And, Kumari’s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.

On hearing Kumari’s situation, government officials of India have decided to come to her aid. She is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. Even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.

In 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. Even though the government of India is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases. 

Let's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.

Hence there is a fear of what may be implemented in the name of UCC. There are chances of taking away religious freedom enshrined in constitution. Many countries across the world allow personal laws of each community as long as they are not going against the constitution. 

Like triple Talaq was made illegal as per demand of Muslim women but the government also made it criminal act by introducing jail terms by the BJP on its own without any such demands from the women organisation. Why? It is such actions from the government that make people wary of BJP and its aim in introducing UCC. 

BTW India is not a secular nation, so maybe they should just declare it a Hindu rashtra and just enshrine protection for minorities in constitution including reservation like in Pakistan. "

We used to sleep on the roof at night when we were kids but it impossible to do because of all these monkeys terrorizing us.

But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day.

130,Need help regarding my career. Specifically MBA.,9,g35581,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g35581/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/,22,1587169196.0,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",False,AskIndia,"This post pains me because this is nearly the exact circumstances I found myself in 2 years ago, and I took a poor decision.

2 years gap, 97.68%ile, though I did sit for SIBM and SCMHRD but no luck there and no luck with new IIMs as well.

All around poor interviews and family pressure was mounting. I took a bad call and went to a sub par college which dropped to a tier 2 during my 2 years there, even tho I had a call from IIM Amritsar (didn't go there coz I'm an idiot and family knows better than I do).

My advice? Either you get baby IIMs or a top class college which has great placements for your intended Specialization and job profile intention (plan this out in advance, don't keep it as 'I'll figure it out as the years go by' thing).

Call up the current students by getting in touch through LinkedIn and ask for a brutal opinion with full confidentiality.

An MBA is quite literally a chance to turn your life around. And possibly the last decent chance you'll get in an Indian context.

Hi reddit.

For context, I am 20F and my cousin is 28M now. I was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. I live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so I thought I would get the best opinion here. 

I've made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). I would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. Long story short, when I was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (I think he tried to touch my ""area"" but  I started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when I was sleeping). For those of you asking why I didn't stop him after the first time, I was scared of not being believed but I did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn't. Anyway. Recently I have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. I was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn't allow me to heal from this. I'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. Our family is very close so I've been around him A LOT these past few years, and we've had a lot of great moments together and I *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. I want to forgive him, especially for myself, but I don't know how to do that. Personally, I know that I need to have a conversation with him about this but I don't know how to bring this up. I don't even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but I think I'm prepared for both of those outcomes. My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness? I know it's a healing process for me, but does he deserve to know that I have forgiven him? Also, how would you go about this situation? Any and all advice is appreciated! Thanks!",False,AskIndia,"He is not a good person, let's get that clear first. He was 24 when he did this. It's a clear case of abuse and he's a pedo.

1. You either expose him and shame him before family and get the release you need
2. take him aside and vent! Doesn't matter if he admits or not, get the closure you needIrrespective of which option you choose, in the end forgive him and reduce / cut contact with him. Forgiveness doesn't mean he was innocent or that he deserves it, it only means you choose to close the chapter and walk to a bright future ahead. If you don't forgive and put it behind you, it's going to keep rearing it's ugly head in future. Not worth it. Wasn't your mistake anyway.

On 13th December 1971, US President Nixon redirected the 7th Navy Fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the India-Soviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression. Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on 13th December, 1971 under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India. 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet, so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India, for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them.

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal, the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'We are too late, the Russians are already here'
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed America's mind and they retreated.

Russia further went on to say 'A war on India will be considered a war on Russia' and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang (a region in China) if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh.

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world.

He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid.

News channels are running shows day and night how Tabliki jamat members spread virus to remotest places in India. Actions of few Muslim people (Incident in indore and tiktok video of a guy from Malegaon) gave it more fire. 

This is going to have long term effects. Amount of hate that is being circulated on whatsapp groups, news channels, Twitter and other forums is going to last longer than this corona virus fiasco. Many of the people who were able to remain tolerant (yes I am using this word, because they were not liberal only tolerant) of the Muslim people only because they had business relations with them are now talking about cutting off ties with them. Already news are coming where there been attacks on masjid and doctors refusing to treat muslim women. Once this corona virus fiasco is over, no one will pay attention to how Government failed it's duty towards daily wage workers, health workers but this incident will be highlighted and it will be used for political gains.

220,101 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre | Background | Aftermath | Shaheed Uddham Singh [Mega Thread],255,g0dofi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0dofi/101_years_of_jallianwala_bagh_massacre_background/,52,1586789095.0,"***\*Picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, I've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\****

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.

Hey Everyone,

I am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine. I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic

Note : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include

**TLDR**

1. Beard Trimmer -

Economy Segment - [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Price - Rs.1349 . & [Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Price - Rs.1199

Premium Segment - [Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Price -Rs.1999

2. Full Body Grooming Kits -

Economy Segment - [Beardo Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) Price Rs.1299

Premium Segment - [Nova 1153 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3)\- Price Rs.1599

3. Hair Clippers - To Trim and cut your hair when you are at Home

[Nova Hair Clipper](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) Price Rs 1295

**Detailed Analysis**

**Beard Trimmer**

**Economy Segment**

[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349

Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings

Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched

Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi

**Premium Segment**

[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings

5 Attachments - Beard Trimmer, Body Groomer, Nose & Ear Trimmer, Precision Trimmers, Body grooming Comb

No competition in this price range. Product is good reviews are great

**Premium Segment**

[Nova 1153](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-ng-1153-digital-usb-runtime-160-mins-trimmer-men/p/itmca2da42c534bc?pid=TMRFGDD3G2C7JPG3) Rs 1599 v/s [Syska 3052](https://www.flipkart.com/syska-ht3052k-02-runtime-50-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97a98575ca758?pid=TMRFGYCDZ2FA3DFZ) Rs 1599

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

**Hair Clippers**

Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now

[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

Hopefully the information turns out to be useful. If you want to know anything else just drop a comment",False,Non-Political,"I have a Wahl Hair Cutting Clipper. I can cut my hair from the behind using a mirror, I can cut the front hairs using a scissor, but the middle hairs are extremely difficult. 

Anyone know how to cut them? If I use the clipper it seems like it will practically make me bald, and scissors seem extremely inconsistent "

There is no set date on when this content will leave Hotstar. I guess it will be timed with the shutdown of Hooq.

I ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. I also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

255,My Covid-19 quarantine experience,1947,ffyots,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,158,1583805274.0,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

If you have symptoms, report yourself.",False,Non-Political,Hey do you know if you can be infected with Covid 19 again or do you now have immunity?

I just came to know that this plan is not actually unlimited, they apply the FUP after 150 GB, and decrease the speed to 1 Mbps. That's no issue, the issue is nowhere in the app, they've mentioned anything of the sort. They do not have any privacy policy in place, as confirmed by their marketing department as they reached out to me, although the customer support team never did, so my issue was never resolved.

I contacted Vodaphone 7 Times, with no response from their side.
Since the last month, I've been hung up, had a blank call, and have been threatened by Mr. Tarun Rathod (Saying ""kya kr lega be"" translation: ""what will you do?""), when asked for a supervisor. I have recorded phone calls of every instance.

Not to say that Vodaphone also advertised ""Superior customer care Experience"" with the purchase of this pack. This is their costliest packs in India, and they also have an exit payment of 3000 inr, if I want to go back to my normal plan after opting into this one! Not to mention the bad tactics they play subscribing all users to random monthly plans every month. The whole company is scammy. Now their solution for me is to wait till the lockdown of 1 month is over, and then ""reach out"" to the customer care store, after paying all my bills of that time!

I have tried complaining on all their emails, trying all the customer care and lines where in despite of saying that the customer care executive will be available from 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., never have I been put through with a real person. There is a 15 minute waiting period where the music plays, And The line goes silent. No one says anything, the the helpline stays connected as long as I don't hang up.
Their emails are not monitored. When from heaven's Grace I receive an answer, it's from about explaining me the details of the plan, even in that they do not mention any FUP!

Idiots think that my poor cat causes corona and gave 2 of my 5 cats away. Bastards. My grandma straight up kicked my cat and called it bastard. I told her indirectly to never come to my house. These stupid ‘ustads’ (muslim priests) make some videos on YouTube saying shit like this , which my granny listens to and tells the rest of my family who like fools agree with what she says. “Chickens,goats and cats” cause corona it seems. I asked her, people have been having these animals for millennia. And my cat is an indoor cat for god sake. I’m not very religious but my family has turned into some cult right now. Full time these Islamic speeches will be played in YouTube at full volume which irritates the shit out of me. They are in Arabic too, my family doesn’t even know Arabic , they think listening to it will bless us and protect us or some shit. My mom posts all this religious stuff and saying allah is the best and some of those sentences sometimes make it seem like she’s in a cult and totally brainwashed. It also affects my dads business, you know how? Dad and mom works together as an event company and most of my dads clients are Hindus , who after seeing all this try to stay away. It may sound crazy but there are many clients who have often told other clients not to make events from us since we are biased to Islam. My dad tells my mom not to be so religious atleast in social media where thousands of people will be viewing. It’s kind of like her business number. My moms name sounds very much like a Muslim name so they decided to change it(not officially) to seem neutral to all religions. You ask why go to such extents, it’s just a religion? My dad almost lost an event from a multi millionaire because his friends circle were Hindus and told not to organise event from us. Instead go to other alternative , he stayed with us but guess what happened next? He didn’t pay the amount of the quotation(bill) and flew to Singapore. So that my dad doesn’t call him. And on top of all this shit, now this coronavirus shit happened and they bring religion to all this and I feel like I’m in a cult. I don’t like it, if I’m at home I’m on my PC from morning to night so it’s not a huge problem for me. But since there are holidays for everyone , my mom always takes us to our granny’s house where everyone stays (joint family) , all these people who have jobs are currently staying at home and including the ones who were always jobless are together. It’s a huge cult now, all day I’m asked to pray, every 5 minutes(almost literally) I’m reminded that cats give coronavirus and insults to my cats keep coming. Although there’s clearly NO evidence to it at all. They also say that the world will be wiped out by this virus since it’s written in the Quran or something which I don’t think is true.

They conduct loud Pujas during Navratra, twice a day. They conduct havans, Jaaps, Jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. Our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. 

When they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, I can hear them yell at each other - ALL DAY LONG. They call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. Nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

This made me think - What's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general? What would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?

The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words.

Have a blessed day all!

She has ties with some Medical representatives (MRs) where they give her medicine to sell directly at rate cheaper than the shop. She then sells that medicine to patients directly or sends them to the medical shop. Shopkeeper gives her all the money sold from the medicines back.

 She once showed me a brochure which contained different gifts based on number of tablets written . It was a Plasma TV for something like 8,500 tablets but she chose something else.

She also does this thing where she sends a 50rs injection to the medical shop (which dad owns but rents out to others) and writes  a different injection name on prescription paper worth Rs. 5,000. Patient pays 5k to shopkeeper who then brings the money, injection back to her. 

She was really frustrated when they introduced compulsory attendance of certain number of medical conferences per year for doctors. Luckily, MRs get the certificates of conferences for her so she doesn't have to attend a single one! She stores some medicines directly in the medical shop that MRs giver her which she writes and the shop owner gives some commission to her for them.

 She has tie ups with a pathologist, where every patient she refers to him, he gives certain amount of money back to her (like 30%) from his fees. Once, she was showing me pathologist's report for fun to read. I found value of platelet written - 45,000 and underline under it. Normal value written next to it was 150k I think. She said without even looking its 450k, read again. I double checked but nope it was 45,000. She looked at it and got very furious. She immediately called the pathologist and said how dare he didn't tell her immediately and only underline it for her. She said that patient would have gotten serious if not died with that low platelet count. She said, she will instead send all patients to a different pathologist who gives her more cashback from now on if he does something like this again. 

Once a civil surgeon came to check her records and she had them badly incomplete. I remember she was facing removal of her sonography machine at least. Luckily, dad went to meet the civil surgeon few times and paid him around ~1L to keep queit. Mom was complaining how stupid these records are, how much work she has to already do. How unfair this all is on her.

Mom casually mentioned she failed final year of her MBBS but dad paid a lecturer to pass her. How her diploma doesn't mean anything because it is from a non certified organization; but it has the same initials as the official diploma so people would get fooled into thinking she has one.


GORE AHEAD - Parents Hospital is on ground floor and we live upstairs. Growing up, I used to regularly see different meat like parts in a regular dustbin, next to her operation theater. Once a stray dog was eating what looked like placenta from the dustbin. She would pay money to some midwife to dispose off fetuses and bury them into ground somewhere secluded. She was pretty mad when someone complained about her throwing bio hazardous waste in the surrounding area which did she used to do I think.

She reminds me without fail regularly how much money she earns and how many people recognize her outside because she is doctor. How much respect doctors get in society. She would say would say none gets as much respect as doctors do. Once we were going for a family vacation and a bike going at speed got slammed by a car right in front of us. I asked dad shouldn't we stop and help them, aren't you guys doctors and are supposed to help?"" Dad said, ""Who is going to spend that much time taking him to nearest hospital? The guy is probably very serious if not dead already."" So, we chose to continue to our trip.

E: I never meant it as some sort of PSA.  It was more of a venting from my childhood memories . Mom has been very abusive to me and recalling those memories; I have lot of amnesia around them and it is very stressful, anxiety inducing. Its easy to type these ones out because they don't involve me. 

Also they might seem clear to you guys, but I have lived in that home for 21 years. My first memories are formed  while living with my mom. This is quite the norm in my house and I was exposed to only these values, culture, environment most of my life. Parents wouldn't let me go outside much either, I was suicidal for a long time. I am very gaslighted from living with them. It feels really nice to know these things are very looked down upon and every comment helps with the gaslighting.",False,[R]eddiquette,"Unethical or illegal they don't care.

In effect, the state of Jammu and Kashmir will now cease to exist; it will be replaced by two new Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. UTs have become states earlier; **this is the first time that a state has been converted into a UT.** The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have an Assembly, like in Delhi and Puducherry. The UT of Ladakh will not, like Chandigarh.

So, not only has Jammu and Kashmir lost its special status, it has been given a status lower than that of other states.

It is also likely that corporates and individuals will be able to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir. Non-Kashmiris might now get jobs in Kashmir. A process of demographic change might begin, and progress over the coming decades.

# Indian Opinion

Writing in the [Indian Express |  The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal  ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-kashmir-article-370-scrapped-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-bjp-5880797/), Pratap Bahnu Mehta says

>This is a state for whom the only currency that matters is raw power. This is a state that recognises no constraints of law, liberty and morality. This is a state that will make a mockery of democracy and deliberation. This is a state whose psychological principle is fear. This is a state that will make ordinary citizens cannon fodder for its warped nationalist pretensions.

>India has betrayed its own constitutional promises. India has many asymmetric federalism arrangements outside of Kashmir. This act potentially sets the precedent for invalidating all of them. How can we justify offering Nagaland asymmetric federalism but deny it to Kashmir? Its implication is that the government can unilaterally declare any existing state to be a Union Territory. This is a constitutional first. We are simply a union of Union Territories that happen to be a state at the discretion of the Centre.

>What is playing out in Kashmir is the warped psyche of a great civilisation at its insecure worst. The BJP thinks it is going to Indianise Kashmir. **But, instead, what we will see is potentially the Kashmirisation of India: The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal.**

Writing in [The Wire | Constitution Torn to Shreds as RSS Indulges Article 370 Fantasy in Kashmir](https://thewire.in/politics/constitution-torn-to-shreds-as-rss-indulges-article-370-fantasy-in-kashmir) Siddharth Varadarajan says

>Not only has Union home minister Amit Shah stripped Article 370 of its essence, he has gone one step further and abolished the entire state as well, replacing it with two ‘Bantustans’ – grandly called ‘union territories’ – in which key decisions on a range of issues like law and order and land will be taken not by the people and their elected representatives, but by bureaucrats from New Delhi.

>Except, J&K has already enjoyed the rigours of Central rule for nearly 10 of the past 45 years, and has turned out none the better for it. The last 12 months have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself calling the shots, through the president and governor, but the situation there continues to be even worse than it was when the BJP helped run the state government along with the People’s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2018.

>Make no mistake about this – what Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have unveiled on Monday is not just an assault on the unique place that Jammu and Kashmir enjoys in India but on the very federal structure of the Indian constitution. If they spent their first term in office undermining a whole host of institutions, Modi 2.0 will target the one institution that was still somewhat intact – federalism.

Writing in the [Indian Express |  We are just at the beginning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/article-370-kashmir-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-govt-5880796/) Imad Ul Riyaz says

>My appreciation for India, and that of many other Kashmiris, and the desire to stand by it in the face of hostility and bullying back home, was sustained by the Constitution. Today, we are dejected, appalled and feel betrayed. The issue is not just about the abrogation of Article 370 — it is about the unconstitutional manner in which the exercise is being carried out, the way national and international treaties have been violated. Most importantly, it is about the manner in which the views of the people of Jammu and Kashmir were ignored.

Writing in the [Washington Post | Modi’s Kashmir gamble may be good politics, but peace should be the ultimate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/05/modis-kashmir-gamble-may-be-good-politics-peace-should-be-ultimate-goal/) Barkha Dutt says

>Yet this serious gamble for the future of Kashmir — which could either be a game-changer or set back peace-building efforts by several years — plays politically well for Modi and his home minister and second-in-command, Amit Shah. For one, it pleases Modi’s core base and delivers on an old promise (the ruling BJP’s manifesto had always promised to implement this). Also, with the exception of only a handful, most political parties have backed the government for what it has called the “integration of Kashmir into the mainstream.“

>The Modi government has scored a political victory. But will it alter the course of the 29-year-old insurgency in the Kashmir valley? One of the most worrisome aspects of the last few hours has been how the government has treated mainstream Kashmiri politicians as if they were anti-national separatists. Many of them braved great dangers and faced great pressure to contest elections and maintain allegiance to the Indian state. Weakening them further — one leader told me the latest move “reduces them to zero” — raises questions about who the government opens a dialogue process with should the time come.

332,I was about to be falsely accused in a harassment case today but got saved thanks to some good samaritans.,1044,cjtxxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cjtxxj/i_was_about_to_be_falsely_accused_in_a_harassment/,225,1564531860.0,"My apartment has a gym which can be used by the residents. Today I walked in a little early at around 6 PM. When I entered the gym, the first thing I heard was an older lady telling me to get out. I replied excuse me, as I was genuinely confused. To which she pointed at the door and said get out in a louder harsher tone. This really irked me and I confronted her and asked her to talk politely to which she said gym has ladies time from 4 PM to 7 PM. I told her there is no such rule written anywhere and asked her to show me proof. To this, she replied to go talk to the manager. I told her since it's her claim, she should show me proof to which she said don't argue, just get out. I told her even I can bring a couple of guys in the gym and tell you, people, that this is gents hour if I don't have proof, to which she shouted even more loudly saying don't talk back and asked me to get out. I just scoffed and proceeded to walk to my workout station where she physically stopped me and said something like such mannerless youth come here nowadays. I replied saying, I am just asking a question, which I have the right to and proceeded to my workout station by walking around her.

I think this hurt her ego, and she went and called the manager. When the manager came, she told him I was rude to her and was harassing her physically (her claim was I pushed her and went) and her aunty squad was backing her up. In fact, this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her. This is when I really wanted to whack her, but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor. Luckily, some other women in the gym stood up for me and said I didn't do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying (which she was). When she knew she wasn't going to win this, she started demanding an apology from me, which I obviously refused. This is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later. I think that's when the manager realized the lady was full of shit. He then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules. I told him, if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule, I would have left. I just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason. 

Dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks. Just because they are old, they think they can get away with anything.

**Tl;dr: I was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because I asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym.**



**Edit: Manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that, to which I said that's fine. This rule was instated some 3 days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building Whatsapp group (which I am not a part of since my brother owns the flat). So the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her. But she didn't want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions. I told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesn't happen again. I also told him, the only reason I got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive.**",False,[R]eddiquette,"I honestly think you need to go apologize and thank the manager.
He didn't do his job, it's his mistake.. yes I agree.

But just say,


 'thank you for taking responsibility, you could have just blamed it on one of us but you didn't. Thanks a lot. 
And sorry you had to apologize because she was too stubborn. I appreciate it deeply' 

You have nothing to loose.. but you will have a strong ally by the end of it. "

Appearance wise I consider myself unlovely. Instead of leaning on euphemism to make the truth palatable I'll state unabashedly that I'm short and ugly.

I was born to a family of modest means. Since childhood I've never been an exceptional performer at school. Probably featured in the bottom few. Not that I was indolent. Despite my best efforts seldom did I perform better than the average.

I followed the herd and ended up studying engineering. Now that I'm trying to look for jobs hardly anyone is interested in me as I'm unexceptional. In this brutally competitive world can someone as vanilla as me attain great success? Repeated rejection in romantic life, professional life has eroded my self belief. 

I had a suspicion ever since I was in my early teens that I was unintelligent. It'd take me a much longer time to grasp a concept compared to my peers.

Even take the case of Radha, she was lover of Krishna, but she is most commonly worshiped as Radhe Maiya.

>India had informed about Counter Terrorism (CT) action it took yesterday against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan based on credible evidence that JeM intended to launch more attacks. Against this Counter Terrorism Action, Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully.

>The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side. In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.

Highlights

* Indian Air Force officer addresses first. Pakistan Air Force planes were intercepted. In the aerial combat, one F-16 aircraft was shot down by an IAF MiG Bison. IAF lost one MiG, he says and refers to the capture of the IAF pilot. 
* Pakistan resorted to indiscriminate firing on Feb. 26 and was befittingly retalitated.  Given the high level of preparedness Pak designs were foiled.  We are in a heightened state of alert, he (Army Maj. Gen Bahal) says. 
* Navy remains poised in all three dimensions to defeat Pakistan's provocations. 
* AVM Kapoor says piece of evidence is being presented about the aircraft being used by Pakistan based on electronic signature.  Pakistan media reports showing engine parts were not of MiG 21s, he says adding that it could be concluded that F-16s were used.

Remember the outrage that Nirbhaya case caused? Kathua's outrage was less. Unnao's even lesser. These days, there is no daily newspaper without a rape case.

Remember the outrage when a minister said peacock reproduces by tears? These days, even our HRD minister spews such bs on a daily basis infront of highly educated audience no less.

Remember Mohammad Akhlaq's lynching case? The accused was seen in front row of a CM's rally. Ramgarh mob lynching? A minister garlanded the convicted group. In Malegaon blast case, the accused is a minister now. Again, mob lynchings have become common news these days.

Remember DeMo (oh wait, I am sure you would)? How the govt. was criticised for an unplanned decision making? There's one such decision every month. A record number of bills have been passed in the 100 days of govt.

The eruption that #metoo, casting couch scandals caused? An actress coming out these days would be seen as 'just another'. One popular outcome of that is the dissolution of AIB. Where are the other popular accused these days? 

Remember the 2G scam? Mining scam? Lalit Modi? Mallya? Nirav Modi? Panama Papers? Yeddy diaries? He is the CM of Karnataka now. That time when Jagan Reddy went to jail? He is the CM of AP now. 

Jet airways? Air India is slowly getting there. BSNL almost there. HAL racing to reach both. Automobile industry, ONGC has their first hits recently. 


Dollar rate was 48 when I was writing GK exams at school. Where is it now? 5%, what is 5%?

It's the story of frog in a hot water bath. We are going down, slowly but surely. 

Sorry if I made you sad. Cheer up! We have to support India in our next series versus South Africa and btw, how is the boom in kashmir real estate and matrimony industries?

EDIT: Thanks a lot for the appreciation. I now understand that this is a well known issue called ['Overton effect']( https://youtu.be/_v-hzc6blGI). 

In all honesty, I don't mean to offend/take pot shots at any particular thing/group. When Nirbhaya happened, our batch discussed about for a week. I used to be very vocal. Kathua, Unnao took it down to an hour. Last month, there was a news of <1 yo baby kidnapped, raped, and murdered in my own state. There was a news of rape of a dog. I don't feel a thing except for a minute or two.

I want to do something about all these but I see myself becoming what I hated. 'A privileged guy who just goes about his job but never raises his voice'.

Interviewer; why are you visiting US

Uncle; I am a widower, single and wish to stay with my son

I; where is your son staying

U; my son used to work in poona and now working in new York along with my daughter-in law

I; which company your son is working for

U; my son used to work in poona and now working in new York along with my daughter-in law

I; do you have any other children

U; two daughters, married and living separately. I am widower and living alone

I; how long you wish to stay with your son

U; two daughters, married and living separately. I am living alone and wish to stay with my son

I; how long you wish to stay with your son

U; will stay as long as possible, I am old, don't know, I am widower..

U; took the passport saying thank you unknowing his Visa application got rejected

I knew about Jio deep packet inspection and blocking but it wasn't much of a concern to me as I didn't mean they got direct access to my network devices.

However that changed after I got it installed and running today. Basically the router is locked down. You can't use non Jio routers to connect, there's no username / password settings to use for another non Jio router.

The biggest security issue is your Jio router can be managed by my Jio app like changing SSID, password, blocking device etc and it works even remotely (outside your WiFi network). So the only thing stopping a attacker is myjio authentication which I'm sure can be cracked. Moreover if they get access to network from Jio side, they can literally do anything. Run exploits against your networked devices etc.

And remote management is disabled by default so there's no way to stop myjio app access.

There's no one one waiting for my return. If I were to stop existing I suspect no one would care. There was a point in my life that the absence of a family hurt me.


But now I'm numb. I'm in a sea of humanity but alone in the boat. My eyes go moist on seeing others celebrating life's little victories with their families.


A distant relative of mine to silence my litany of complaints about life advised me to visit a counsellor. I did that. Other than receiving some impracticable advice I learned nothing.
My soul is disembodied. It wouldn't be wrong to say I'm a living corpse. I force a smile to be polite when I see people. But a little part of me dies on doing so. I too wish to be loved, to be wanted.

The major point which people were saying was this “Bigger fines means more money in the cops’ pocket”. So my take is why even give them a chance to give them a challan let alone take a bribe from you. If all of the rules are followed, there’s absolutely no way you can be issued a challan or even try be asked for a bribe. If they still do, I’m pretty sure you can actually take strict action against them. Don’t even give them a chance to ask for a bribe ! 
Drive safe guys and have a good day. 
PS : Happy Teachers Day

PPS : Sorry to hear so many of you still get fined even if you follow the rules. Seems like you have a pretty terrible share of cops compared to where I live. But still I stand by this.

Fake crying, foolish customs that make no sense, women huddled up sipping on tea gossiping and chatting/joking, suddenly they see someone walked in the door and they cry like they care the most. I was close to my nani and I cant take this disrespect.

This is from Rajasthan if someone is wondering. Is there nothing I can do to stop this bullshit?

Edit- What im getting at is, most of the stuff people do at funerals(atleast in my region) is to ""show"" others how much they care(even if they genuinely dont care someone died).

Just think of a simple birthday of a colleague.   Introspect on your own behaviour. Do you really care when you say 'Happy Birthday', do you care about the present, do you eat at the birthday lunch/party, .... if you do this to people you care & not care, dont be surprised if people you dont care about (and who dont care about you), come to your bday party to have a good time on the freebies.

**[Congress Manifesto](https://manifesto.inc.in/en/)**

The BJP Manifesto is available in Hindi and English, while the Congress Manifesto is available in Hindi, English, Odia, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Assamese.

I've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. The manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. I have covered the points which I believe are easier to judge on implementability.

* Congress manifesto is longer.
* BJP Manifesto doesn't allow to copy text (even though it is a PDF document).

---",False,[R]eddiquette,"You can't fight a cult of personality with ideas and rhetoric. 

Godi media TV channels successfully brainwashed the electorate that Modi is Mhysa, a savior who ""sacrificed"" everything for ""Bharat Mata"", a ""strong"" leader, a person who works ""18 hours a day"" serving the nation. The ""300 killed in balakot"" bullshit was flashed non stop and was swallowed by the people. Ask anyone and they won't say they voted for BJP, they would say they voted for Modi. They might not even know who their local candidate was.

All the justifications we give like - maybe Jan dhan worked, maybe Ayushman worked - are hollow. Nobody cared about these schemes. BJP had the weakest, emptiest manifesto and no messaging on real issues. People voted for the superhero named Modi. A fictional character carefully crafted with a backstory, unrealistic achievements in his childhood and youth and reinforced with ""a day in the life of"" narratives with questions like mango eating and wallet keeping.

Modi occupies the same space in the psyche of the electorate which a godman or a ""chamatkari baba"" does. 

The southern states patting their backs for not voting for this charlatan shouldn't forget how they too have similarly worshipped leaders like MGR & Jayalalithaa in the past. Modi image building was from the same playbook in fact, creating a larger than life persona. Education has nothing to do with this. This is solely a lack of critical thinking and failure to question the narrative set by the mainstream media which comes from the ""accept what you're told"" mindset Indians are brought up with. "

But that's not the main problem here, the main problem is it's very difficult to criticize Hinduism. Unlike other major religions Christianity and Islam, Hinduism suffers from a dissociative identity disorder. Many people argue that it's *a way of life* or *a cultural identity* unique to the sub-continent and not a mainstream religion. But in reality, it's very evidently a religion. When someone questions the verses of the holy scriptures, the best reply they get is *'Oh! we Hindus don't follow our scriptures very strictly like the Muslims & Christians*'. When someone questions certain practices in Hinduism they blame it on the culture, tradition & society, even if they are the ones who said Hinduism is a way of life, not simply a religion. This double standard confuses many young people trying to question their faiths and in the end, they give up and reconcile themselves believing that Hinduism is not completely evil like other western religions. Many people still can't comprehend the evils of the caste system and how it has affected the lives of the lower caste communities for thousands of years. Even I was living in denial, back when I was a kid I believed that the *varna system* in Hinduism is not evil and the evil caste system was created by the British. At least that's what I was taught when I first questioned that system.

Many smart Hindus argue that you can be an atheist and still be Hindu because there were many ancient atheistic schools in India, like the *Charvaka*. But the thing is Charvaka was an exception in Hinduism, not the rule. Many other ancient cultures were quite similar too, who were absolutely materialistic and atheistic. Claiming that they were all modern secular humanists who considered nothing but science would be even more wrong. There's nothing common between modern-day atheism and those ancient cultures except disbelief in supernatural. I still don't get how someone is a modern-day atheist and still be a Hindu culturally or otherwise.",False,[R]eddiquette,[deleted]

I went to the counter to pay as usual. There were two people in front of me, an elderly man and a woman in her 30s. As the woman was paying, the elderly man cut the line to get something he forgot. While he was gone, the woman finished her transaction and left. It took another 20 seconds for him to return. I stood there along with another woman behind me out of courtesy for the old man.  When he returned, seeing us waiting, he apologized and thanked us. We greeted him and smiled back. Fair enough

Now it was my turn, as I was reaching to my pocket, 'backassward-ly"" a young man in his teens enters the shop, grabs himself a loaf of bread and stands right in front of me. I froze for a second. It was the most extraordinary transition to an ""unexplored territory"". The cashier herself was visibly irritated. She told him that she was attending to me and that he should fall back in line just like everyone else. He smirked and stood behind; in between the lady and me. I couldn't handle his behavior and flipped. I said to his face, what he was doing was wrong and he should have the least courtesy towards other customers. He had that look in the face which completely describes and ghetto teen filled with cynicism and packed with attitude. 

The woman behind me told me to calm down and let him get over with. I paid for my shit and left.

As I reflect now, there is one thing I realize. If we wish to change the country for the better, it should start from us. At the end of the day, you can only change yourself.

I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry,  who was this Bharat Mata, Mother India, whose victory they  wanted? My question would amuse them and surprise them, and  then, not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at  each other and at me. I persisted in my questioning. At last a 
vigorous Jat, wedded to the soil from immemorial generations,  would say that it was the dharti, the good earth of India, that  they meant. What earth? Their particular village patch, or all  the patches in the district or province, or in the whole of India?  And so question and answer went on, till they would ask me  impatiently to tell them all about it. I would endeavour to do 
so and explain that India was all this that they had thought,  but it was much more. The mountains and the rivers of India, 
and the forests and the broad fields, which gave us food, were  all dear to us, but what counted ultimately were the people of 
India, people like them and me, who were spread out all over  this vast land. Bharat Mata, Mother India, was essentially these 
millions of people, and victory to her meant victory to these  people. You are parts of this Bharat Mata, I told them, you are

Jeez, it makes India sound like a corporation founded by Nehru. Which I suppose legitimises handing the reins over to his descendants after him.

We're probably the only large power in the world which is NOT expansionist. We just want to keep our home safe, and not capture other areas to spread the idea of India to others.

Bharat Mata is the land of our gods and ancestors, protected by the Himalayas to the North and the East, the oceans to the South, and the rivers and passes to the west. Our mythologies like the Ramayana involve complex cartography defining the land. Rama didn't annex Sri Lanka, he left the locals to rule it.

Even Alexander the Great learned this lesson the hard way. The Indus was the border for every other civilisation.

Pakistan is an idea. India, like Israel, is a place. With an idea, but not just limited to it. It's a civilisation, and those are generally referred to by their geographic identities.

&#x200B;

• Increasing the NPA of banks means. Scarcity of capital which means no fresh investment. The glorification of bankrupt law and Continuous scams in companies

• Homes are not being sold which means sale of  steel, cement, bathroom fittings, construction declining. With this banks NPAs will grow. These NPAs go deep into individual level by making the crisis deeper,

• Vehicle sales are declining. At present first time in the country sale of  two wheelers are showing negative growth. Maruti has cut down production by 50%. Many of the auto dealers are closing down. This means  there is substantial reduction demand for steel, tyre and other accessories.

The above three things are meant to be the end of the crores of jobs and the reduction of government's tax revenues.

For the past few years, even the  FMCG sector is  also in the  grip of recession-. Do you remember  when you have  last seen Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Company's advertisement?  Patanjali was most active on TV about 2 years back., but for last one year, the condition of even Patanjali  which grew at the fastest pace in India's FMCG market is alarming.. Sales of Patanjali's products is shrinking.  Apart from this, Patanjali Ayurveda has shown 10% Revenue Deficit in FY 2018. Not only companies such as Patanjali but Hindustan Lever also have come down in growth. Demand for fast-selling consumer goods such as soap, toothpaste, hair oil, biscuits etc. has decreased considerably in rural areas. This has also slowed down the performance of those businesses, which are dependent on healthy rural demand. It includes FMCG, two-wheeler and auto companies that make entry-level cars.

Now come on the transport-According to the  report of the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training,  15% drop in truck rentals has reported since November 2018.  Also Fleet Utilization has dropped more than that. All 75 trunk routes, rentals have gone down substantially. Between April and June, Fleet Utilization has decreased 25% to 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. This also reduces the income of transporters by about 30%. Many operators may also come in the Fleet's EMI default in the next quarter.

There is a clear impact on the freight demand because of reduction in industrial production. Demand from the manufacturing sector, which contributes the most to truck transport, is at minimum level. Consumers spending in cities and rural areas have reduced and transportation in agriculture has almost become sluggish after the peak demand of April. In June, the demand for fruits and vegetables by FMCG has decreased by 20%.

Due to the decrease of the freight demand, truck fleet has reduced by 30% on all major routes of the country in the first quarter.",False,[R]eddiquette,"Are you sure there will be a recession, or just a slowdown?

Happy Onam to all!

This is a good time to remember the  Onappattu that will be reverberating around Kerala now - the song that  kindles memories of how things used to be when Maaveli was King, before  he was unjustly sent to the Netherworld through trickery.“When Maaveli  was ruling the land, all humans were equal”. Then the rest of the  stanza: “They lived happily and there was no danger to anyone.”“There  were no worries and no diseases. Evil people were nowhere to be  seen.""""There were none around other than  people of goodness. There were no lies, and no cheating and no false  promises. There were no false measures or crooked weights and no other  falsities either.”Notice that the song says nothing about Maaveli  himself, neither his physical powers nor his generosity or other  personal qualities. The song only talks about the kind of society that  flourished when he was around.The fulcrum of the song, therefore, is  about social relations.Equal dignity of all individuals. Fairness,  justice and lack of lies and cheating when people deal with each other.  There couldn’t be a better articulation of the ideal society.Remember  that during much of the recent centuries, Kerala was no haven of  equality or fairness or justice. It was, as Vivekananda called it, a  “madhouse” - of caste supremacy, extreme inequality and prejudice. But  the song kept the flame alive.And so did the Maaveli story. Ideas, as  they say, have consequences. So the next time anyone wonders why Kerala  is what it is, one could say: may be Onam had a lot to do with it!The  Maaveli story with its distinctive sympathies, is not a one-off.Some of  the folk dance performances of Kerala, like Theyyattam, are built around  the stories of those who were punished with death for infringing caste  rules.These performances deified those who were thus killed and kept  them alive.Onam in that sense is also a yearly performance that revolts  against forgetting, and sets up the right ideals for a society to strive  towards.Onam comes around every year because Malayalis haven’t reached  those ideals yet. But they’re on the way. Come hell - or high water!

Now 2 years have passed and I've done nothing basically (although I did brush up some coding here and there, but nothing on paper) .

I have just started coding again, started with cs50 on edx but still feel bad considering I am 24 and still learning the basics. and god knows how would I explain that 2 year gap.

I am also somewhat depressed as my friends are working on 10 lpa+ jobs whilst I'm still at at big 0.

If that helps I have 80% in 10th & 12th, and 7.3 CGPA in my grad. 

Looking for some advice as how to follow through so that I could end up with a decent job.

I am in deep regret, & I am ready to work my ass off. I really want to ctach up to my classmates, even better them but I don't know how. 

Any help is appreciated. Also Is it a good idea to cover it up with a fake startup? I mean I could create a website and show it as my 2 year work? Can they catch me? If not, Any other advice? 

Should I go freelancing ot hunt for job, I live in Indore if it may help.

My dream is to get into some big product based company. I am willing to do any amount of work for that.

Thanks for listening folks. If anyone had a similar phase let me know.

Edit : I think people mistook me for not liking coding. I'd like to clarify that I didn't ever dug up coding, I was naive so didn't knew much, was lazy so didn't tried much either. Now that I've started learning programming seriously, I love it.

So, please don't think I am doing coding because I'm desperate. I actually want to do it. My concerns are how to cover up my 2 year gap and get back on track.

Background: I(M24) have been with my girlfriend(F24) for around 1 and a half year now. Our relationship isn't the most stable, my GF has anger issues and I am not the most easily forgiving person either. We fight quite a bit. A few weeks ago, after a major fight my girlfriend told me ""let's not commit right now, let's see each other but not commit"" I was okay with that, I don't really love her or anything, and I keep thinking about other women all the time. Additionally, I'm a virgin while she's had a relationship before and lost her virginity in that. I've always wanted to have my first time with a girl I actually loved and cared about, and possibly was married to.

We've made out in the past. Indulged in some fingering but that was it. Today, we decided to meet for a short while in our favorite spot where we always do. We sat and talked. Long story short, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Being my first time, it was all over in 5-7 minutes. After I was finished, I sat there in a daze. My GF asked for water and wanted to clean up. I sat there, as if I'd been stupefied. It took her repeating herself thrice before I paid attention to her.

Even as I type this, it is very difficult for me to come to terms with my feelings about the entire affair. Even after we bid each other goodbye and I walked to my apartment, I walked in a daze, where I was mechanically doing everything without really thinking about it. I looked around and I literally had trouble perceiving the world. Its like, I took in the sights and sounds but my brain wasn't processing them.

I feel no joy. I feel no happiness that I had sex barely 2 hours ago. All I feel is a void, where some sense of gratification should be. I don't love this girl. We fight so much. And who knows what complications this might lead to. I want some love, I want to be able to look into a woman's eyes and know she's the one for me as I have sex with her. I don't feel this way about my current gf. And I hate this feeling. This is why I had refused to have sex with her so far. I have never felt so distant from her as I do right after having had sex with her. This is a bad sign, right?

I don't want to say she made me do it. True, it was she who took her pants off and pulled me towards her, and guided my penis inside her. True, but I was there . I could have stopped her. And she probably wouldn't have resisted. I did not. I could have said no, but for some reason I didn't. I don't want to pretend like I was forced into sexual activity. I was there with my consent.

She is very happy about us finally having sex. I am not. It just feels wrong.

I feel like I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but IDK. I'm not sure who to turn to with this. I'm a man. I'll probably be told to shut up and be happy i'm getting action. But I don't feel happy about this. How do I come to terms with my feelings?",False,[R]eddiquette,"Dump her, find someone who actually loves you "

441,So many consultancies are trying to dupe students/freshers looking for jobs. This is what happened to me.,307,c84t0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c84t0z/so_many_consultancies_are_trying_to_dupe/,65,1562070737.0,"I am looking for a job while currently pursuing my masters. Since i graduated in economics with no technical skills in hand, the majority of jobs being offered to me are crappy BPO and backend ones. 

Me and my friend who's in the same boat decided to apply on job portals and we start getting all sorts of calls hiring for voice/non voice process. Some of them were bonafide but i think, majority of them were from fraud consultancies. I got an offer for an interview in Delhi's Badarpur and accepted to come for the interview. The day before, i was wondering that nothing good has ever happened in Badarpur and did a quick google search only to find a consumer complaint filed against the 'consultancy' that i was going to. 

A few days later, me and my friend got another offer for an interview in two consultancies that were in very close proximity to each other. We, being the idiots we are, forget to double check and went to the agencies the next day. I, although asked everything about any hidden charges and ofcourse she lied.


The one i went to made me wait for about half an hour for the interview, i have given interviews before and knew this is not how it works. *Mujhe pata chal gaya tha mera chutiya kat chuka hai.* The interviewer was hardly 10th pass who was struggling to ask questions in English and the moment she uttered i can offer you 35k, i knew this is a scam and she's about to ask me for money which she did. There's no way i can get 35k even if i sold my body to a pimp. So i stormed out of there and called my friend.


What happened with him is more interesting, when they asked him for money, he got himself out by saying he need some time to think. He went down to smoke and he saw three police officers marching towards the building. The moment they saw my friend they asked ""how much were they asking?"". My friend replied 10k but he gave them nothing. He showed them the way inside the building.


So my friend was sitting outside the room where the interviews took place watching the entire raid taking place. A BTech graduate who paid 2k rupees as 'security' to the the frauds comes after giving a ""telephonic interview"" and says to my friend *bhut tough interview tha, aadhe ghante grill kia*. The police officer shouted from inside *koi interview nahi tha, iska pati hai vo*. This poor delusional guy was still under the impression that he'll get the job untill everything was explained to him.  He gave the lady 2k rupees which the police got back from her.



Any adequately informed job seeker who has given at least one interview knows that only frauds asks money from candidates but i guess there are still people who in desperation, will oblige and pay.

I also feel like an idiot for not cross checking this time and believing everything she told me over the phone like no hidden charges etc.


This all happened 2 days ago and i have another interview lined up later today for a fairly good profile (no BPO/backend crap) after clearing an online test for it. It's the real deal and it'll give an okay start to a fresher like me.

That said, i still feel like an idiot that i went there and waited 30 minutes only to get conned.",False,[R]eddiquette,"Ha! Literally went through the same stuff, you did man. Got called for such 'interviews' atleast thrice and and by the end they were asking for 7500, 1500, whatever. At one time, the girl taking the interview kept decreasing the price until she said 'dont you even have 200 ruppees?' 

That felt so hilarious.

On the bright side, I did manage to get a BPO job yesterday through one these consultancies.

Few tips to know if you are looking for jobs through online portals/consultancies:

1. The consultant should be expected to check your english right there on the phone. If they don't, they are fake.
2. They should arrange your interview directly with the company. The original consultancies have an arrangement with companies where the companies themselves pay money to consultants to get them new meat for work.
3. Always check for the company name they tell you they are hiring for and there consultancy name. Check their online reviews. "

Amidst the pandemic scenes, I lost my campus placement. I was not interested in it anyway as I hated the course I took with all my heart(Computer Science). I took it as I didn't have much knowledge about ny future after higher secondaries and everyone said taking computer science would land me a job.

I regret this decision more than anything in my life.

I find many thing interesting, like designing stuffs, may it be posters, cars or anything. My parents and friends always used to say I have an artistic mind. I draw a lot too, good pictures also.

Then I got into photography, I take a lot of photos and still do. Have won 2-3 local photography contests. But never invested in it because I never got time to do so.

Also I never knew how to get into this photography field? I don't know anything else than taking photos and posting them on social media for meaningless likes.

By photography I mean wildlife, landscape, etc. I wish to work for any established companies as their photographer. I really wont care about the salary very much as atleast I would love what I'm doing. The thought of sitting infront if a computer just drives me crazy everyday.

I need help and advice. Do I need to complete degrees in photography to get into the field? Please help me in anyway you can.

assume that each country is under-prepared because most/all are. expect that it will be a shock to the hospital staff when the active cases per day starts rising, because it will be a shock.  

&#x200B;

if you are indeed talking about our planet and you are indeed in india, take all precaution you can by avoiding contact with others during this week, upcoming week and upcoming months. 

&#x200B;

a good advice is to find news from another country and see what they are saying about your country. do not only depend on your country's news stations. 

&#x200B;

i am in usa and it is very much not under control here and india is a week, maybe two weeks behind us in what coronavirus is doing.  

&#x200B;

my goal is not to scare but to encourage others to find information outside their normal sources. i feel this will help people to take things seriously and avoid contact as much as possible which will improve the odds for the hospitals when things really start to get out of control.

> Mr. Naik said a technique for such cure developed by Bengaluru-based Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) is just about a year away from endorsement from his Ministry.

Please note that the media mocked him and he never said it again, but he didn't apologise for giving India's 14 lakh cancer patients false hope. Remember this when you listen to his and his ministry's comments on coronavirus.

Created a cross-platform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.,74,fzzcgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzzcgy/endlessly_refreshing_for_bigbasket_delivery_slots/,19,1586736363.0,"**Live at**: https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier

**Demo**: [Demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

If you’ve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

A medical scientist researching Infectious Disease, for the US Government in Houston who was my classmates in college.

And our friendships are equally deep after his departure to America.

Got a call from him.

His first sentence was,

""Devendra Ji,

* Our PM Modi is some great man, probably.

I said

""Hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

He said, ""We have been doing research in India for the last 30 years on Infectious Disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

I asked, ""Are you also making fun of Modi like seculars, leftists, Muslims, Thukde Thukde Gang, Urban Naxalites, Award Returning Gangs, AAP, NDTV etc in India?""

He said, ""Oh nothing like that, I and my whole family have been citizens of America for 19 years, My annual salary is more than 15 crores in Indian rupees, But the hearts are still Indian.

Every major step and decision of Modi is completely separated from politics, I wish the welfare of India and human beings I also saw Lakhs of Indians are making fun of Modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, But in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of Modi.

You would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on Covid 19 in particular,

All scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, Because Covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

In such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, Currency notes, files, courier parcels, Steering wheels of vehicles Viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, And without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by Modi, Since there is no loss of work due to Sunday,

* The country will be almost free from viruses! * These ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

If any of his advisors has given this advice to Modi then this person is entitled to the Nobel Prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of Modi, then he should get the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his contribution in the medical field of Infectious Disease. ""*

I could not even speak a word.

Here, crores of people of my country are making fun of Modi, Humiliating him as illiterate,

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

There are a couple of things I like here, namely the cheap economy, cheap rent, great housing in newly constructed apartments, great infrastructure with water, gas and electricity.

I'm from a top-tier engineering college and have a decent pay.

Looking for a change in job around start of 2021, and colleagues recommended Bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities (in the category I'd be looking for) and should be my choice above NCR. Some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so.

Here's what I pay for in Noida -

Rent for 3 BHK (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. Electricity is cheap. Gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

What's the equivalent for Bangalore?

&#x200B;

Drawbacks - too few companies to apply for.

We all know that, Mughal Empire completely collapsed 40 years after Aurangzeb's death.

Assuming non involvement of foreign colonial powers, there were mainly two nations that were very keen on conquering Mughal territory and asserting influence: **Sikhs** and **Marathas**.

Since, both were ambitious, war hardened and wary of each other - civil war was the only possible outcome.

[Poor UX of a fairly popular Indian bank's online platform](https://reddit.com/link/ftn4l0/video/feawzp2jfhq41/player)

As seen above, revealing options in select dropdowns requires special tricks. And input fields actually trigger sidebars (or dropdown?) in an already cramped box. Form generally follows function, but seems like the developers at [Finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/corporate-banks/) were more concerned with adding wave effect to the buttons, and slide transition to menus than actually testing their rubbish. I'd give another fifteen instances of atrocious UI, but you get the gist.

If they can't even get the easier parts of writing a web app right, I wonder what sort of nightmare realm exists on the back-end.

There's of course the trend of forcing users to update their passwords every quarter or so. Do you append a number to your password and increment it? Well, most do, which is why it's such a shit form of security, and [advised against by NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05). I feel for the non-tech-savvy folks who are probably writing their passwords down somewhere instead of using a manager. Some banks double down and require separate sign in and transaction passwords, each with its own rules, naturally.

The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50,000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study.


As a layman, I had the following questions:


- What are the possible side-effects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions?



- Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions (quality of water, sanitation etc.), is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely? What implications does it have for the results of the experiment, even if it's carried out as planned? (Link to study for this claim [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/))



- Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past? From what I know, such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale.

***By: Kartikeya Semwal***

With the ever-increasing threat posed by China’s PLA Navy in the IOC (Indian Ocean Region), neighbouring countries like Japan, South Korea and Australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. Till now, none of these countries has an operational Aircraft Carrier (AC). Instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or ALS (Amphibious Landing Ships).

[INS Vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

But more than them, India feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 Aircraft Carriers (ACs). Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[India's Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

Guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn’t have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China’s power projection through it’s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. 

[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

Indian Navy’s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India’s 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.

[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

But there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China’s PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. 

  

[F-35 B taking off from US Aircraft Carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)

One point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin’s F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce’ modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. 

But again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won’t be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won’t be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft). 

[F\/A-18 Super Hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)

On the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won’t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy’s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts.

Now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.",False,Science/Technology,"America won't less India F-35's.

I should have worked hard in my 11th and 12th and cleared JEE, I admit. There is no good education in India outside of the IITs and only handful other elite institutes. I was a bright student in primary school and had big dreams and high expectations. But something happened after 10th and it all went downhill there on.

I am a first year undergrad studying physics in a shitty university. I love physics and I hope to have a good career in the field. But going to college only demotivates me. It is a colossal waste of time. The teachers are all stupid who very likely bought their PhDs. They don’t even know the basics. I am forced to put up with their bullsh\*t everyday, goddammit. Every lecture feels like a torture. I am an honest, sincere and a hardworking student (not bragging) and I don’t deserve what is happening to me. I don’t see how I am going to be a good physicist without a good teacher or mentor. 

I am severely depressed and have also thought and almost acted on killing myself. I got no friends and my family can’t really do anything to help me. I can’t change or quit college because 1) it’s too late now, I have already lost one year to depression and poor health 2) it is going to be the same elsewhere too and 3) it is a really bad idea to quit college in India. There is nothing around to keep me motivated. I am thoroughly fed up and feel like running away from here. I am very scared for my future.

If crores of people install it, just using wireless heahphones is enough to track your location.

It picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. So even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

This is a complete anonymous account and it has technically no traces of it back to me. This was created on a disposable Kali Linux Virtual Machine using random proxies all over the world! This is technically a throwaway but I kinda like the name I got with it.

The account creation process was already slow due to chaining proxies but then it was pretty slow to verify captcha each time! But it is doable. you need to setup proxy-chains on Kali Linux and configure it using tor's random proxies and then you are kind of done for the network anonymity but then comes the challenge of actually assuming an identity. You have to avoid all the general personal traits while creating the accounts. I chose proton mail for the email client but still it asked for a verification using mobile number! This step took a lot of time as I had to get a phone number which cannot be traced to me but well lets say it was taken care of. After you have a mail id set up and ready to go, you can pretty much get going on to sites which does not require a personal verification using some kind of mobile number. I think authenticator apps can work but I do not have a spare phone which I can load a FOSS OS on so that step is missing.

It is definitely doable, but you have to be very careful just in case you accidentally reveal some important info regarding yourself. This should help any one trying to get her or his word out and are kind of in a fix due to their identity being in a crisis. I would encourage people to be anonymous but be genuine, which is a hard thing to ask for given the anonymity! Kind of a see saw in my opinion, one always goes down when the other comes up. Trust and Anonymity that is.

For those who treat reddit like a social media: Yes I have negative karma due to one comment which I posted, but then reddit karma isn't my doing, its all of you in the community!

VoLTE is very vital in this current environment especially for Airtel and Vodafone. This is why:- 

1. CSFB is a very slow and resource wasteful technology. The phone needs to switch to an available 3G or 2G network whenever a call has to be made or received. 
2. Both Airtel and Vodafone are switching off their 3G networks in phases resulting in even longer connect times when circuit switching to 2G GSM network. 
3. VoLTE does effect your call quality. The codecs used for VoLTE to VoLTE transmission is of 12-14kbps which is higher than your traditional call bit rate. 
4. CSFB works optimal when the legacy networks are using lower frequency than the LTE network. This is now not the case as Airtel and Vodafone are refarming their 900MHz bandwidth for LTE and shifting 2G communications to 1800MHz.

Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. We Indians are so fucked if this gets here!,43,fbxmmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbxmmt/who_findings_after_trip_to_china_5_of_people_who/,17,1583113763.0,"The WHO has sent a team of international experts to China to investigate the situation, including Clifford Lane, Clinical Director at the US National Institutes of Health. Here is the press conference on Youtube and the final report of the commission as PDF after they visited Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media:

When a cluster of several infected people occurred in China, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.

5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. A total of 40,000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.

China can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: In Guangdong province, far from Wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.

The vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.

The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

An examination of 44,672 infected people in China showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. Fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.

Healthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.

Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

Age: The younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:

table placeholder 

Read: Of those infected in China, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). Of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.

Gender: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

The new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.

Since the end of January, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. ""This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real,"" the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.

One of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1,800 teams in Wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. That means: If you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.

Finally, a few direct quotes from the report:

""China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. China’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.""

""Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.""

""COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.""",False,Science/Technology,We are already fucked 🤟 ...

I've gone through a lot of technical details between the roland fp10 and the yamaha p-125 from past month now (quarantining my ass off on this comparisons)  
I know the FP-30 is a better choice but the prices here in india...i think i'll have to sell a kidney to buy the roland. its stupidly high !.  
Roland   FP-30 - goes for RS. 72,824 or $952.96   
Roland   FP-10 - goes for Rs. 59,973 or $784.79  
Yamaha p-125 - goes for Rs. 53,189 or $696.02 

I know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry (im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later) and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for (post processing? i dont know the right term for this). Thats why i prefer the Rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action (no i haven't tried them yet, because guess what, noone even has them on display here in the entire state).

My Questions  
1 - Yamaha Or Roland - which will age better? (lot of roland youtube videos complaining about loud keynoise after 4-6 months of usage while yamaha has no complains on the same). im planing to use this keyboard untill it fails to work or dies on me 7+ years easily.

2- Is that price tag justifiable for roland? i mean should i pay 100$ + just for the 3 key sensors ? 

3-i want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on (like Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata (3rd Movement)) which should also be fine on yamaha right?

3- Do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity ? most indian sites say ""does not come with bluetooth"" which i sort of need. anyone in india purchased this?  
4- Can I just use an addon accessory via the usb to host to transmit the bluetooth data to my computer? because in this case i can then get the yamaha and purchase the accessory.",False,Science/Technology,Hey I think your best bet would be to contact someone from Furtados and get their opinion.

I have a dedicated server with GoDaddy that I use to host simple wordpress sites. One day I randomly decided to log into the server to check one of the sites and realized that I was unable to access the hosting. After sometime with tech support I was able to log in only to realize that my entire data was wiped clean. At first, the tech support tried to blame this to some ""hacking"" incident but when I kept asking for details such as the method of hacking, ip addresses used and other info, they reluctantly opened a support ticket. A day later they came back with a response saying that there was a problem with the server and they were moving the data which they lost somehow. They lost 25 sites that were hosted and didn't even offer an apology.

> The said email has come to our possession which shows how maliciously Dr. Gaurav Trivedi is trying to demolish Dr. Brijesh Rai, Himanchal Singh and me. I couldn’t believe somebody holding such an important position could stoop so below moral standards. When we are fighting against corruption and the corrupts, we are fighting from the front, upholding the ethical, moral and constitutional standards, but Dr. Gaurav Trivedi, on the other hand, is pressurizing and compelling students to fabricate false documents against us.
#ENOUGH_is_ENOUGH, not a single stone is unturned to defame Dr. Brijesh Rai who has never opted violent path to put his words across. Dr. Gaurav Trivedi hasn’t spared me even. He is continuously conspiring to harass me and my friends as well.
As you all can see in the attached email, Aditya Sanwal (GS, Welfare Board, IITG) is addressing a competent authority informing him that he is mentally traumatized for IITG’s declining image and is asking for ‘NECESSARY STEPS’ to be taken against us. But in reality, these thought-provoking words are not Aditya’s, but the letter was actually written by Dr. Gaurav Trivedi to make a false document against us. Aditya was pressurized to sign the document and give a false testimonial. Later, he was asked to collect the hard copy from Praveen Tiwari (Dr. Trivedi’s student and aide) to whom Dr. Trivedi intended to send the draft from his official email id.
However, Dr. Gaurav Trivedi was so desperate to urgently deliver results, that instead of sending the draft to Praveen Tiwari, he sent it to Mr. Tiwari’s namesake, Prof. Praveen Kumar of EEE Dept. The eye-opening precious document is now in our possession which tells us how much one can conspire from the behind.
This also forces me to speculate, God knows how many fake documents have been fabricated till now and are still being produced. We suspect that in the upcoming BOG meeting these documents will be used as an excuse by the Director, Prof. T. G. Sitharam to terminate Dr. Brijesh Rai. After Dr. Brijesh Rai is done away with, Himanchal and I will be next. "

Market capitalism (in whatever controlled form) in India in the last \~25 years has actually lifted more people out of depressing poverty despite all of this --- Indians are much better off today than they were 40 years back. Look at the big picture. There will always be micro-statistics that will enrage and outrage. Given India's population spread (1.3 billion people), the extremes by definition will be wide. India can certainly work to open up the markets more to make sure the lower end of the extreme is not depressingly extreme.

In the West, this kind of meme is used to promote inaction, high taxation and has led to crippling self-imposed stagnation. India is not there yet to consider that option --- there is plenty to do before armchair socialists can promote wealth inequality as a social issue. Right now the problem in India is that many people have not enough to do. "

Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Hope it wil be as successful as social distancing practiced by people during Janata Curfew clapping.

Thanks to Modi ji I will now find out who are the intelligent people in my locality by looking at whether their lights are on.

Meanwhile, a day earlier on 19th, Gujarat-based firm CoSara had already received an approval to start manufacturing Covid-19 test kits. This firm is a collaboration between a US-based company & an Ahmedabad-based firm.

CoSara's kits already have US FDA approval.

Some of the other 18 firms who were waiting to get their Covid-19 test kits validated said that these would be sold at a price of 400-500 per kit (far cheaper than imported ones). 

CoSara, on the other hand, refused to publicly divulge the cost of their Covid-19 kits.

Suddenly, on 21st March, the Health Ministry issued guidelines allowing private labs to conduct Covid-19 tests. The cost of these is capped at a whopping 4500 rupees.

These guidelines have one caveat - ONLY testing kits approved by US FDA/European CE can be used.

That means ONLY kits manufactured by Ahmedabad-based CoSara can be used for Covid-19 testing.

So after allowing 18 firms to test their kits for production, the Modi govt. suddenly changed guidelines to favor ONLY 1 Ahmedabad company (whose testing kit cost is unknown).

Why is a Gujarat-based firm being provided a monopoly on Covid-19 testing kits by suddenly tweaking guidelines overnight?

Why are 18 firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines?

Update: Now the health ministry in its press conference today has said, that US FDA and EU CE approval aren't mandatory. So, now Roche and CoSara are two companies who have the nod from them to manufacture and sell test kits. But the question remains why they haven't validated others as well. Either reject their application or accept it, why sit on it when test kits are badly needed.

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

Uttarakhand workers in Ahmedabad were then duped of Rs. 18000 and stranded midway when they tried to use these buses to return home.",693,fu7wnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu7wnt/during_lockdown_uttarakhand_cm_on_amit_shahs/,43,1585947272.0,"Link to the story: https://www.bhaskar.com/db-original/news/amit-shah-vijay-rupani-latest-updates-on-gujarat-pilgrims-return-from-haridwar-rishikesh-over-coronavirus-lockdown-127094521.html

Since the story is in Hindi, here's a summary of the events as reported by Dainik Bhaskar

>गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. 

>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

>मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। 

Instead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway. Some were dropped off in Harayana, and some in Rajasthan. 


> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।

It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

>दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।

On the other hand there are people like Mukesh Kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 


###Dilip Ghosh, BJP

Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",False,Politics,[removed]

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1. Share Market –
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their coin.zerodha.com to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3. Insurance :
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…

But only death benefit, else you won’t get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . Health insurance is a must though.",False,Business/Finance,Thank you so much!

Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time.

935,PSA: Don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cards,121,ftybqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftybqp/psa_dont_opt_for_the_3month_moratorium_unless_you/,23,1585903576.0,"I see a lot of misinformation floating around about the RBI moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, I guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
When you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      

Credit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",False,Business/Finance,[deleted]

Alternative credit score & Automating the Entire process to reduce the Turn around time of loans into seconds

I want to solve this problems 

- In India, Just 35 millions pay Income tax out of 130 millions. Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. 

- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. 

- Credit Risk - Risky Business 
 
Predicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. 

Unlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. 

By building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. 

- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.

- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.

- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. 

- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they don’t use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. 

- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.

- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible.

3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour.

1. The EMI ofcourse is still due - but it will be due after May has ended. The interest on unpaid amount will continue to be calculated during this time. 
2. There won't be an auto-debit during April and May.

This will be my first job in India and I have some very basic questions:

I am a bit confused on some of the allowances in the offer breakdown - I have been offered a base salary and along with that I get house rent allowance, special allowance, vehicle reimbursement and internet allowance.

1. For house allowance - do I have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? Or do I have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? Does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?
2. Do I have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?
3. How do I claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?

Basically trying to understand how much I can expect to get as a salary deposit in my account

Thanks!",False,Business/Finance,"For a simpler calculation... If your salary is above 20L then you get between 20-25% deducted as tax and other prerequisites.. So about 75-80% will come as in hand every month... From the tax components... You need to put it in various schemes and et all to save on tax... So that's a hassle i dont think a new person wants to get into esp since the 1.5 lakh limit gets very easily exhausted and the HRA exempt is on actuals... So unless you have a home loan on your account.. You dont have much you can do there
On the 75% ish you get in hand..  Will be what you get paid and is post tax..  So if you are getting paid X annually..  A simplest tool is to do (X/12)*75% as your actual in hand salary... On the conservative side
Let me know if you need any help with the specifics "

**Given the current Indian financial market situation me and a friend had this dialogue to try and understand if bitcoin is of any use to us.. may be it helps you start a conversation with someone else and get a better understanding of things.**  

I’m a stock market trader and recently I was talking to this friend of mine who is into bitcoin as  well as the stock market.. 

He asked me if I knew why bitcoin was needed in this world.. 

And my answer was.. An alternate currency

Turns out it’s got an actual reason for existing

**BTC is an alternative to fiat currency? or “store of value” like how Gold is?**

But Bitcoin is not like Gold at all. 

* Gold is valuable as a metal. 
* It is soft, malleable, 
* very good conductor of electricity, 
* safe to the skin unlike copper and does not tarnish over time. 
* If we needed gold in large quantities and cost wasn’t a problem, we can actually create gold in particle accelerators. So it's not a matter of gold being scarce

**Bitcoin has no physical value like gold. Bitcoin is all digital.**

&#x200B;

**A Simple Though experiment:**

Let’s assume I open a bank called DVZ bank and people have deposited a total of Rs.1,000 with my bank. 

* Now people and corporations come to me asking for loans and I give them a combined loan of Rs. 10,000. 

Where did the extra Rs.9,000 come from? 

You decide whether this is a problem or not for a financial system.

**As it turns out, in the modern world, money is just a number in a bank's software. It can be tweaked any way the controlling authorities want.**

As an authority, without a few people in my pocket, I  could set up a XYZ business just for the purpose of creating money. XYZ business would never make a single rupee in profit but we will keep adding new money into the XYZs bank account every month. It's our bank. Our software. Our database. Who is to stop us? 

Whereas Blockchain is a self-regulating database. 

**Once an entry is made into the blockchain, it can not be edited without destroying the whole database. It maintains integrity by nature.** 

**So, if 21 Million bitcoins are coded into the database, it cannot ever become 22 Million Bitcoins. Whereas in any other currency or banking platform it can be changed.** 

Banks are based on ledgers that can be manipulated by the bank owners and governing parties. 

Bitcoin runs on blockchain ledgers which are immutable.

To break this down ever further, let’s say you have 100 rupees in Paytm Wallet and Paytm’s core developer is your best friend. You can convince him to turn that 100 into 10,000. This cannot be done with Bitcoin, if that is done, the whole database breaks.

Has this ever happened? Paytm has been accused of internal fraud by audit companies multiple times. A Famous incident that can be quickly searched online is where an ex paytm employee created fake transactions in order to earn from cashbacks. Total fraud of over 10Cr. 

The loans given out in Bitcoins will be real bitcoins and not fake money which eventually turns into real money. Banks give out money that they don’t have and don't recover, that leaves a hole in the financial system.

Blockchain is attempting to provide a very clean and efficient financial system, to have a record of what’s coming in and what’s going out. If implemented successfully, we will do away with printing money and bringing in Helicopter money during times like these. It will all be a zero-sum game then.

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",False,Policy/Economy,Do we know how much of that money did they allocate to each state?

https://preview.redd.it/7f60yfc3dbu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=295bf3a056f250df993c0705d5545d303816e197

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

We don't have the capacity to manufacture ventilators . We import them .

We don't have the capacity to manufacture the high grade PPE required for this pandemic . The local manufacturers need machines from foreign nations to make it . Hence we have to import them too 

We don't have the capacity to make advanced drugs . India mostly makes generic medicines . Hence we need to import them too .

USA and Europe already have a shortage of ventilators and masks . Despite that they haven't forced their companies in any way to not sell to foreign nations . In fact when trump tried to do that in USA against Canada , he was shat on by everyone and given the middle finger . 

However , if India goes ahead with ban on medicine exporters , then trump will be proven correct and his standing will be strengthened.

**Tl; dr**

In today’s speech announcing the extension of India’s national lockdown till 3rd May, 2020 the country’s Prime Minister requested citizens to [**download the** ***Aarogya Setu*** **application**](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/pm-modi-says-aarogya-setu-app-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-covid-here-is-how-it-works-2576857.html). Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF’s Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.

**Background**

On April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called,  “[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)”. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.

IFF’s working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government’s *Trace Together* application, MIT’s *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.

**What is Contact Tracing?**

According to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.

Contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   


As a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user’s device comes in contact with another user’s device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  


**What’s the Risk?**   


With the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief,  most apps which are purported as ‘contact tracing’ technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.

A lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between “snake oil” and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.

Such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.

It may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.

**How to prevent these risks?**

Such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:

1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary
2. All data should always be stored locally on people’s devices
3. This data must be encrypted
4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.
6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is “voluntary” and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  


Therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:

1. Strict limits  (in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and
2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way

**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**

https://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b

Consider the following aspects.

**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**

In other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.

In India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.

To protect people’s right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.

**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**

1. Singapore monitors people’s interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there’s India which uses both**.
2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India’s Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zy6tp8hvbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ea4b8aca61a8e38ec771f8ad785c5211b2bf17

https://preview.redd.it/mnrv4i6wbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f8c169d0699880af385910b6ee8b4799d23955

**No Transparency leads to discretion**

The only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.

Similarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app’s Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.

**No Accountability and No Auditability**

The Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government’s processes are compliant with the right to privacy.

Second, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people’s personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.

**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**

Finally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.

Finally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people’s informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.

**Conclusion**

IFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people’s informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.

Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

## Tl;dr

With a view to address the public health challenges due to Covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India.  This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

We devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing.  To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It's possible if we try!

## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off

The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

However, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.

Recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## Overview of the working paper

This [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

Following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

Finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

## We have three primary objectives from this working paper

*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.

*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don't have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?

We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

This working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

Every single entity in the power business is losing money, nobody wants to invest in the sector because no one cares about contracts and generators don't get paid.

I guess the author will be satisfied when everyone just packs up and goes home eventually and the country is left with severe power shortages.

If the Andhra Govt can arbitrarily declared contracts to be void and call for renegotiation, there is something fucking wrong and there is absolutely a need to enforce those contracts and do it quickly, not 5+ years later when the judicial system comes around to it.

As for private monopolies being better than public monopolies, first of all, none of the proposed privatisation is going to result in private monopolies. Private participation is either done through a PPP or through a licensee model. Not to mention that power distribution is a heavily regulated business. You have to bare it all before the regulator to set tariffs.

& despite this, private operators have consistently proved to be better than state discoms on metrics across the board. Just look at the metrics of Delhi Distribution when it was ""privatised"" in the 2000s.

The author also states that the bill seeks to eliminate subsidies and cross-subsidies and make electricity a luxury item. The author doesn't state that the bill seeks to calculate the tariffs without any subsidies so the tariff determined is actually reflective of the costs incurred and that if the Govt wants to subsidise any particular consumers, they should pay the consumers directly.

As for ""midst of the COVID-19 crisis"", does the author expect everyone in Govt to sit on their ass for months and get nothing done?

The only parties who benefit from the abysmal current state of the power sector in India are under performing state distribution companies and its employees. It is no surprise that the guy writing this article is a patron of a federation representing those exact parties. "

For some reason people seem more receptive to giving up certain food groups or activities to make their alternate medicines work, but bring up exercise and diet during a routine check up and the doctor is scoffed at (“look how out of shape the doc himself is”, “he didn’t spend even ten minutes with me and is criticizing my lifestyle”, “just prescribe _____ for me, doc!”)

Modern medicine doesn’t have the answer to many many problems, but they are held accountable and most things are backed by evidence. Similarly there may be remedies in alternative medicine for non-life threatening conditions but even those I’d be wary of due to loose regulations, but you do you.

https://preview.redd.it/zy87u6z1uqq41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b456dedb4224dca0f38034a8c4be6011624aaf

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to ensure reform of India’s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### Background

On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework.  The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.

The government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   


### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications

We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*

Noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs

We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

We recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.

# Tl;dr

IFF wrote to the Jammu and Kashmir Government and Ministry of Home Affairs seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Kashmir during the COVID 19 crisis. The region is already struggling to recover from the six month long shutdown imposed on 5 August 2019 and several of its key healthcare indicators are below the national average. Therefore, immediate restoration of 4G internet services in the region is necessary to prevent spread of the virus through telemedicine and effective public outreach.

# Free and Open Internet for All

[\(Screenshot of ToI's tweet before it was deleted\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfb2xn7mkyo41.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed515e7a9ee26e760826e15eb81d154e0395548c)

&#x200B;

Yesterday, the Times of India tweeted that 4G internet services had been restored in Jammu and Kashmir but it subsequently deleted the tweet and published another [**article**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fake-alert-order-claiming-4g-internet-to-be-restored-in-jammu-alone-is-fake/articleshow/74814962.cms) about this information being false. This led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

While the rest of India transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest COVID 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2G speed in Jammu and Kashmir.  Jammu and Kashmir already has 7 confirmed COVID 19 cases. With these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the Government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives.  

# Dashboards and Chatbots for All

While responding to the COVID 19 crisis, the Indian Government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. Take for instance, the Ministry of Health’s COVID 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. The Ministry of Health and MyGovIndia have also collaborated with WhatsApp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. Even private players like Apollo Hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing COVID 19 through a mobile app. However, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the Government is slowing down their internet speed to 2G which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.

# Telemedicine for All

The difficulty in communicating through video on a 2G internet connection also means that doctors in Jammu and Kashmir cannot use telemedicine. During pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. Reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. However, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2G internet services.

Healthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. The essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the Ministry of Home Affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. Therefore, depriving the people of Jammu and Kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the Government must immediately restore 4G services to reduce suffering and loss of life.

Under Trump and his America first policy, America has receded from the world stage leaving space for China, space which China used to gain influence over the WHO, the current chief of the WHO always had a favourable standing with China, with his rival for the chairmanship of the WHO Dr David Nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current WHO chief has close contacts with China and it's leadership. These allegations are further reaffirmed when the WHO chief went to Wuhan on the 13th of January 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the Corona Virus. The above events show Trump's failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage. Trump also took the Corona Virus very very lightly, downplaying the intelligence over the same provided by his own national agencies, he has previously ignored serious advisories by his national agencies, for example Russia's interference in US elections and the Khashguni murders. 

Now coming to India, no political party in India has ever worked on the health infrastructure, other than a few marquee projects like building one or two AIIMS. This is the same for this government as well, however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities. Currently India has .8 doctors per thousand patients, which is well below recommended standard. I'm sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to AYUSH doctors.

When the Delhi state government, started to build Mohalla Clinics, then the current ruling national government tried it's best to stop their development, the D.D.A, which is controlled by the Central Government, didn't alot them any land, forcing Mohalla Clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins. As they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. Now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the Corona Virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in South Korea.

The question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in Hungary.

Edit: I would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in India also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in India, it's doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the Supreme Court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having Covid19. Couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.

Edit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of N95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries. In fact a shipment of N95 which was just transiting through a U.S. port ""disappeared"", the shipment was heading to Germany.

Is Trump crazy, he is isolating America and Americans at their time of greatest needs. For example Germany is a major industrial power, it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of Ventilators, what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards? Canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from Windsor Ontario to North American cities like Detroit.

I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 

I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 

As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself can’t curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it.

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction.

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* Poor were left unbanked and were left in the lurch. They suffered significantly. Delay in wage payments, drop in incomes and loss of employment disproportionately affected the poor due to their reliance on cash. (Source - [Hitting the bottom](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/hitting-the-bottom/article9992462.ece))
* Unemplyment soared significantly to 45-year high of 6.1 percent between July 2017 and June 2018. It is estimated that 33 lakh people permanently lost their source of employment.(Source - [Life after Demonetisation: How India's poor are still paying the price](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/life-demonetisation-india-poor-paying-price-190614135641262.html))
* It directly/indirectly led to death of around 100 Indians. (Source - [Indian Banknote Demonetisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation)).

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.",False,Policy/Economy,"Not to nitpick but analysis need to go further into the ugly part also.

I was confused as to what vaccine, because I thought there isn't a vaccine yet. They were saying  it was recommended by the  government and everyone is  taking it to be safe and I should take it too. They then told me it’s a homeopathic medicine that everyone is taking to be safe from corona virus. Its called Ars Alb 30. A homeopathic medicine based on Arsenic Album. I laughed it off and told them its all stupid whatsapp forwards and homepathy doesn’t work etc etc and didn't bother much about it. 

But, my sister recently had a baby and when I met her MIL she gave me a packet telling me they were medicines for my sister. I gave them to my sis and she asked my why I am giving her [this](https://i.imgur.com/qVKmkZQ.png). I was baffled and eventually realized this was the ""corona vaccine"".

**Tl;dr**

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group  is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors  like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

**Tl;dr**

With reports now emerging that the Delhi Police is using drones to check for people who are breaking the curfew in Delhi, we examine responses we have received in reply to Right to Information requests filed about the usage of drones in Delhi in February. The Delhi Police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections and during the riots in North-East Delhi. This is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.  


**Wait… What?**

The Delhi Police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. The first [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/anti-caa-stir-delhi-police-use-drone-to-keep-track-of-protesters-1629729-2019-12-19) emerged in December, 2019 when it was reported that anti-CAA protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. This was in addition to the Delhi Police’s use of [**Fa**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/)[**cial Recognition Technology**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/) to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the Delhi Police to cease such use [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)).  


Subsequently, there were [**reports**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/from-facial-recognition-system-to-four-layer-security-delhi-police-gears-up-for-r-day-11579892354659.html) that the Delhi Police used drones on crowds during the Republic Day parade in January, 2020 to “maintain vigil”. In February, 2020 there were [**reports**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-riots-police-special-commissioner) that the Delhi Police had used drones to “monitor the situation” during the riots in North-East Delhi.   


Now [**reports**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5146-held-in-delhi-for-defying-lockdown-1018-vehicles-seized/articleshow/74801660.cms) are emerging that the Delhi Police is using [**drones**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/covid-19-drones-used-to-enforce-lockdown-more-booked-for-violating-prohibitory-orders/articleshow/74831906.cms) to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the Government in a bid to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.   


**The Delhi Police confirms using drones**

On February 14, 2020, we filed a Right to Information request with the Delhi Police asking the following questions:

1. Whether the Delhi Police has procured drones for any purpose?

2. Details of the tender issued for such procurement.

3. Information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.

4. Information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.

5. Whether these drones were deployed in December, 2019 and January, 2020?

6. Any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the Delhi Police.  


Our request was transferred to various departments of the Delhi Police. We received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. However, in a reply dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones.    


**Here is a point-wise summary of their reply:**

1. The North-East District has **hired** drones for maintaining law and order.

2. Since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.

3. The Delhi Police has been hiring drones from the open market through Station House Officers (SHO).

4. The technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the PIO.

5. The PIO confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election which were held on February 8, 2020 and during the riots in North-East Delhi which began on February 23, 2020.

6. In response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the Delhi Police, the reply was “no comment”.

**Why does this matter anyway?**

There are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in Delhi.

1. Hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. As a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.

2. Since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. There is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed.    


**So what now?**

IFF has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a [**legal vacuum**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/). The only [**regulations**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183093) for drones in India are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Drones are being used in Delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. It is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. We urge the Delhi Police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urge the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. This is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.

Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi's favourite, for all situations.",False,Policy/Economy,Where did you get your degree in economics?

Quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we're seeing played out in the Coivd-19 crisis. This problem is not limited to India alone, as all of South Asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. 

Political parties don't want to touch this issue, and for good reason - India has a dark past with population ""control"". The Indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past (one child policy). In any event, I personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. 

In my view, what's required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don't have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. Participation will be totally voluntary. The following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-

1. Government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. It could be called the Bonds Issued To Childless Hedonists (**BITCH**). At maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. Instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. The corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. 

2. Alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.

3. In lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. The value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.

4. Medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. I personally don't care for this, but most people do. In any event, Indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.

5. Encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. I think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. 

6. School/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. It's clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. The best way to reduce one's environmental impact would be to not have children.

I want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. However, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. For instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. Naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. Having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its Aadhar database. Further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.

I mean I get the bit about lockdowns, but half the time, its just a shite-show with all the ppl running to the stores, crowding up and being very erratic overall and I am not criticizing that, as that is perfectly understandable, we never know what these ppl are going through, it could be an essential for their ailing grandparents or their cancer stricken child, but does anybody think the lockdowns are almost always haphazard in their execution, and it seems to be defeating the purpose of it all.

Some of the success stories like Taiwan, hk, and even South Korea, its more about social distancing, and wearing masks at all times and practicing good hygiene especially around the elderly, and finally controlling the inbound and outbound flights and treating the airports as ground zero and being very vigilant with the quarantine, hongkong implemented trackers for all incoming passengers with threat of serious consequences i.e fines and even solitary confinement,  and it seems to have worked a treat. Lockdowns were not really implemented as they thought it would be counter productive and stores and super markets and public transportation facilities  were kept open 24x7 with a condition that only 30% of the capacity allowed at any given time, which was actually sensible rather than shutting down everything or having limited operating hours which just creates a mad rush and totally counter productive. 

yeah, I honestly think a lot of countries have never faced a situation like this. uncharted territory really, but looking at the success stories like south korea and hk, and even Taiwan, and replicating the exact same strategies would have gone a long way, instead of haphazardly implementing draconian counter-productive strategies that have not been thought through.

I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

And it is very difficult to treat hyperpigmentation of indian and black skin tones.

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above). 

- Meanwhile the match starts on Aug3 and we all go India...India with ads of Dream 11 and Godaddy after every over, khelo dimag se my friends",False,Sports,"Ahh it’s nothing to has to do about dhoni.

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",False,Food,"I know about 100+ vegetarians, except for the handful religious nutjobs, nobody cares about caste or ""purity"".

1375,Do Indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,21,g07a97,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g07a97/do_indian_restaurants_actually_use_yeast_to/,7,1586763183.0,"Short version:

A  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   This makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

Long version:

I'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  India, which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. While most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I've seen   restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)

Going  back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

The   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more I'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while I'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ](https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ) ,

So   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

a)CHOCOLATE FUCKING CAKE. I'M BUYING ATLEAST A KILO AND THE MESSAGE IS GONNA BE MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS.   
b) Mithai!!! If I knew things would escalate so quickly, I really would have stocked up. The only stock I have right now is of smokes and chocolates.

d) Pizza, burgers, fries, even coca cola(I'm anti anything by that company but now I'm desperate for some junk food) you name it.  
e) Icecream!  
f) Shawarma. oh my god I miss this terribly. 
3. Things I want to drink- I don't really drink but when I do, I'm a spiced rum and coke person (thank you Cambodia) BUT that being said, I definitely am going to buy myself some beer.
4. Things I want to do- Go trekking! I believe nature will be so amazing this time with barely any pollution. 
5. I also really want to go out on a long ride on my bike. Right now my bike trips are limited to buying smokes (which ends in 5 mins) and I definitely need to go out more.
6. Go for long walks, road trips, picnics, you name it. I'm not a ""religious institution"" person, but I'll do that too.
7. Go watch any movie in a theater.
8. Ride a local train. I miss the crowds.
9. Probably you. (Sorry just thought this was funny)

No jokes, I think the list could be longer but this sums up the main things I really wanna do. If any of you around would like to join me for any or all of these things, feel free to send me a message!

My point was that milk ain't no daily essential or superfood for adults. I dont advocate for veganism.

Yup milk is a cheap source of nutrition for kids and I wont contest that but its worth noting that Kids don't have to drink milk. Its a good source of calcium, vitamin D & some amount of protein but other food sources provide these nutrients substantially.

Milk alone cannot fulfill daily requirements for either of those. Especially protein.

As a citizen of this country when I look at the leadership of the CAA protest I can see the people who have been critical of modi since the day he was not even PM.

My questions:
1. Why is making rules to ease the time period required for indian citizenship from three neighbouring countries having Islam as the state religion discriminatory. This CAA doesn't forbid muslims from attaining citizenship as we can see in the case of Mr Adnan Sami.

2. Why is the lie that CAA will be used to filter non muslims when and if NRC is done throughout the country. This is not the fact but a lie and is being spread like wildfire to a large section of indian population which believes it to be true. Do you believe that this is true?

3. Do you really believe that the strength of the crowd on streets define if a protest is for a just cause. What about most of india which is watching all this from their home . Where do they fit in.

4. Is there any chance that the muslim population has been instigated with false information about CAA ?

5. Is this protest also a result of culmination of anger resulting from the previous decisions of the govt and court say triple talaq, ram mandir and also political irrelevance in current indian scenario.

How do you think the common people can trust such protest . "

If DANICS is better, why is there such a huge craze for IAS or IPS even amongst honest aspirants? Do these honest aspirants realize that power to make real change is with Ministers and not with Bureaucrats?

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.

Inspired by this, in 2014, White Swan Foundation was founded. This week, we complete 4 years! 

On our portals, we offer content in six languages, have over 600 articles in English alone, and over 100 videos on our YouTube channel. We’ve also reached out to over 2000 people in our outreach programmes with schools, colleges, ASHA workers, etc. You can see some of those pictures [here.](https://imgur.com/a/2dfBO)

Today, there is 20% chance that one of us will develop a mental health issue sometime in our lifetime. The treatment gap for mental health issues is over 85% which means for every 100 people with mental health issues, only 15 get treatment! We believe that the stigma of mental health and illness can be drastically reduced by knowledge and awareness.

We want to curate many more such conversations until going to a mental health professional for a mental health concern is just as easy and natural as going to a doctor for the flu!

----------
> When a bank makes a loan to one of its customers it simply credits the customer’s account with a higher deposit balance.
> At that instant, new money is created. 

------------

Elsewhere I have read:
> 
> This is how banks function.
> 
> Contrary to popular belief, banks do not lend deposits. This is called the loanable funds theory and it was recently debunked in a paper published by the Bank of England:
> 
> ...
> 
> When banks extend loans, they do what is referred to as balance sheet expansion, simultaneously creating an asset (the loan+interest) and a liability (the deposit).
> 
> The customer who receives the loan is also expanding their balance sheet, simultaneously creating an asset (the deposit) and a liability (the loan+interest).
> 
> The bottom line is, when the banks extend loans, the money supply is increased. When the loan is paid back the money supply is reduced. This is also confirmed in the Bank of England paper.

We are students of IIT Indore who are currently in protest against certain antagonistic actions of the administration, laws and rules violation, dissolution of students gymkhana when issues are raised and the general official attitude of the administration that the students do not have a say in the official functioning of the institution.

[Our previous thread is linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7rq17h/requesting_help_from_redditors_for_the_entire/), as well as a few older ones about this particular IIT [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5824lx/iitindore_to_introduce_60_hostel_reservation_for/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4s29ba/pg_students_at_iit_indore_are_facing_some_severe/).

As you can clearly see in the aforementioned three threads, our IIT has been at the centre of controversy for years, mainly due to an administration that believes in an autocratic style of functioning. This is an IIT in which even faculties and staff are not allowed to speak to media (this is actually part of the IIT Indore statutes).

The aforementioned three reddit threads should provide the relevant background on the origin and cause of the current standoff and lack of official/written communication between students and the administration.

We would also like you to go through the **[announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vtxad/ama_announcement_protesting_students_from_iit/)** for this AMA, where a brief (!!) background is given for the issues at hand.

Hey, my name is Raghav Mandava, and I am one of the first comedians from Delhi. I was at the very first open mic organized in Delhi in the summer of 2009. I have played a major part in shaping the current comedy industry and even some of the comedians you may know today.

• In 2010 I started a company called Cheese Monkey Mafia for organizing open mics and pub gigs. Many house hold names of today did their first five minutes at the shows I organized.

• My additional skill set is best explained as a producer and talent scout. There is an article I wrote in 2015 about some of the upcoming comedians that I thought people should see, https://lbb.in/delhi/raghav-mandava-delhi-comics/

• I have even shot sketches and videos for comedians, here is an example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYsrdh15XY8

• In 2014/15 I worked with the Australian High Commission to host their comedy competition RAW, where the winners went and performed in the Melbourne Comedy Festival

• In May 2014, I was lucky enough to be on the opening Weekend of a comedy club in Malaysia called the CrackHouse.

• 2017 Got featured in GQ Man of the year edition, but not as one of the men of year.

• Here are a couple of clips of my work

Stand Up - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRQ7f6jhwtM

Although I’m a bit of a social media recluse, I have noticed a lot of discussions about comedy in r/India popping up lately; I would love to add to it. If people here are curious about the inner workings of comedy, and how it has changed over the last decade, I would love to offer my insights. This is of course, if you would let me, because I don’t want to come across as someone is who is coming here to promote himself, but I really love comedy, and I like discussing it with people.

Hey everyone!

I am Jaya Ramchandani. I am a science communicator and have recently started to teach IB physics and general science.

I have been working with innovative educational projects making astronomy and physics accessible to the general public. 

Today, I am here to answer questions related to interdisciplinary projects like art meets science, informal, out-of-the classroom learning, and lifelong learning for all.

I co-founded 'The Story Of' Foundation because while studying physics I found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to Eastern philosophy. So I started to ask the question then, why doesn’t contemporary science talk more often to Eastern philosophy? That was one of the bigger motivations behind setting up the platform. We involved artists and designers in a big way because they are great at thinking about abstract topics and giving them form.

You can see our past project The Story of Light 2015 here: www.thestoryoflight.org. The Story of Light received international recognition in the UN’s International Year of Light education and outreach panel. 

In the upcoming project, The Story of Space 2017, http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/ we welcome everyone to join us in Goa from 10th November to 19th November for our festival. The Story of Space provides unique learning experiences around space exploration, migration, urban architecture and other contemporary issues associated with the word ‘space’. Essentially, we explore ‘space’ from multiple perspectives. Artists, scientists, educators, and philosophers have all come to Goa to create live experiences, a film program, installations, workshops, talks, and panels. The 10-day festival is for the general public, across generations, and is FREE for all to experience. Story of Space 2017.

We are a Non-profit NGO and are a volunteer run project. You can make contributions on our page (link below). If you can't give anything but still want to support our cause please share our link with your friends, family and co-workers. With more people aware of our cause, we will be one step closer to our goal. Donate - http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/donate

I am Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, an app-enabled bitcoin wallet and exchange.

**About Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system. It is commonly called a decentralized digital currency. It was invented in 2009. It is an open source software. This means, that no person, company or country owns this network just like no one owns the Internet. The system is peer-to-peer, that is, users can transact directly without an intermediary like a bank, a credit card company or a clearing house. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. 

Short explanation on what is bitcoin: https://youtu.be/jiEllBFNaMA

A longer version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmU28mgihB4

**About Zebpay & Sandeep Goenka**

Zebpay is a bitcoin app available for Android and iPhones. It is the most popular bitcoin exchange in India. Users can buy / sell bitcoins, top up airtime and buy vouchers of Flipkart, Amazon and more. Zebpay is the first in the industry to launch bitcoin wallet app that enables bitcoin transactions using a mobile number without any complexities to understand bitcoin addresses, taking backups or fear of losing bitcoins. 

In just a year, Zebpay app has clocked 150,000 downloads and crossed a turnover of Rs 450 crores. After early adopters, bitcoins are attracting a new class of users like young professionals and HNIs. Users are now using bitcoin as an alternative investment. They are also using it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers. We believe India will see an explosion of digital assets like bitcoins in next 2 years. Zebpay is on a mission to spread digital assets and bitcoins in India.

The walk is a project of the Veditum India Foundation, and is being undertaken independently by me. A team from our production partner Digital Nerve comprising of Ayan Sil and Rahul Mitra are filming a documentary and capturing photographs. Ardra Venugopal, a Veditum fellow is working on cross sector research in relation to the river and the people living alongside it. We are recording real life experiences of people and the vivid sounds of nature, documenting success stories and that of distress related to the river, collecting social & scientific data and bringing out a first person narrative of the river as a co-living entity, if not the protagonist that it is. The idea is to use research in vivid ways to capture the attention of the audience and speak to them of the state of affairs, not just qualitatively but quantitatively as well. The project provides a platform to collect data for environmental research being conducted across the nation in various institutes.

Through these endeavours, we could raise both funds and awareness for the mentioned causes, translating directly into impact at many fronts.

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already!

About COBRA : CoBRA is a specialized unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) of India proficient in guerrilla tactics and jungle warfare. Originally established to counter the Naxalite problem, CoBRA is deployed to address any insurgent group engaging in asymmetrical warfare.

The Freedom 251 is the world's cheapest smartphone. It was launched in India by a Noida-based company called Ringing Bells for just Rs. 251. What's the catch? Nothing (as far as we can tell).

The device raised more questions than answers: the company says the government isn't subsidising the device; there's a Adcom logo on the front of the device, which was concealed with whitener; and the phone, which is being pitched as a Made in India device for the Prime Minister Digital India plan, blatantly rips off the user interface of Apple's iOS.

I'm here to take any questions you have about the phone. Fire away.

The carbon emissions are a red herring, and we are past the point of no return, no matter what remedial actions we take.

Climate change research, lobbying, years of studying, billions of dollars, and you know why we quit? Because the last time we checked, the planet was still fucked

""So Mankind is the virus, and The freedom 251 is the cure""

Hence, our epiphany. Money won't solve this. Those idiots that call themselves politicians have buried their heads in the sand and stood for nothing but re-election. So we spent the last two years trying to find a real solution. And they found it. Now, if you really wanna make the world a better place, I suggest you open your fucking ears, because I'm about to tell it to you.

The experiences have maintained my understanding that there’s a need to bring these important conversations into the mainstream. This campaign will help us learn and share with you stories of the people of the basin who depend on the river and what urban/rural/industrial activities are doing to the river.

Last time we did an AmA [https://redd.it/4saxeh] i had covered 500kms and was waiting to sort out some logistical issues to continue the journey. 

Current status :

I'm done with over 75% of the journey and it has been an exceptionally challenging task over the course of the past 4 months. For those who have been following the journey from the beginning, it might come as a surprise that i have been by myself and not accompanied by a documentary crew as was the case when i started (refer to previous AmA). Restricted by personal reasons and security concerns, the crew decided to drop out after they had covered the stretch in West Bengal. Though this affected the design of the project as envisioned and also induced a fair bit of mental agony, it helped me re-emphasize my belief that the only limitations are the ones that we put on ourselves.

What this has done though, is that it helped me survive longer on the road with the same amount of funds we were able to raise in the first round of crowdfunding. We'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn’t reach our target and use that to support the Moving Upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion.

I believe that clean air is a basic human right. We are a very long way away from having clean air in Delhi, most parts of North India, and around the world. Air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of Bombay and Madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as Delhi).


Shocking Facts About Air Pollution:

1. 92% of the people in the world  don't have access to clean air.

2. 6.5 million people die prematurely every year because of air pollution. That's more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and traffic accidents combined.

3. Scientists don't yet know the precise extent of health affects of sustained exposure to very unhealthy and hazardous air quality levels, because most air quality research thus far has been done in countries with relatively much much cleaner air than India.


There is no reason why air pollution data shouldn’t be as easy to access and understand as weather data. I’m working to make that happen for worldwide air quality data at http://www.AirAirAir.org.

I built Smokey - It's a friendly air pollution chatbot that works in Facebook Messenger. It is the easiest way to monitor the air quality levels in your city every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself. You can search for “smokey air” in Facebook Messenger app, or just click on http://m.me/smokeybot. It's totally free and works like magic for cities around the world in 33 countries.


Prior to this, I launched a simple twitter bot, [DelhivsWorld](http://www.twitter.com/delhivsworld) - it tweets out hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels compared to Beijing, London, New  York and Sydney.


I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way I can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection.


**Let’s talk air pollution.**

I have a simple question for you: Do you know the air quality in your city today? Do you wear a face mask? Why or Why not?

This is Urjit Yajnik, Physics Professor, but also the unenviable erstwhile Dean of Student Affairs, IIT Bombay from roughly during 2011 to 2015, a position fondly or otherwise called DoSA.  

Here is the [proof](https://i.imgur.com/bMcINPp.png).

I have agreed to do AMA with due encouragement and prodding by [InsIghT](https://www.facebook.com/insight.iitbombay), our own loveable if noisome media body. And they have offered to stand by me through this session, as much as media stand by officials, I guess.

Let me set the ball rolling by what is on my mind as I face the large general body of people but majority of whom are most likely the sufferers of my ""regime"". I am opening up in this particular session to questions that are related to   

* Matters pertaining to IIT Bombay; more generally to the IIT system  
* Higher technological education, in India and worldwide  
* General issues about career choices, future of the relationship between technology and society and what, with my limited crystal ball gazing abilities, may be your available strategies to navigate that.  

To kick off, let me make three points :  

1. What was my abiding motto for handing the DoSA job? It was that students of IIT Bombay and of a campus and academic environment similar to IIT Bombay should live in a self-governed, participatory environment. As you know we have no resident wardens in individual hostels, though the faculty Wardens are only a stone’s throw away. I relied mostly on the fact that students have a responsibility to their own lives and those of
their fellow residents of the campus. And I received ample justification to this belief, in the initiatives and tasks that student representatives or individuals took up, sometimes for the larger student body but often also just for that individual who needed help the most. 

2. IIT Bombay is at present blazing a trail. From the exposure to faculty research output, to the inspiration and infrastructure they receive from IIT Bombay, students and alumni have made the most to put the Institute in the forefront. A large number of alumni and well wishers have also devoted substantial amounts of time and resources to make this happen. We see the culture of fundamental contributions to technology, to management and innovation, as well as to entrepreneurship to grow in the time to come.

3. Career choices. As the world becomes both information loaded and also small in terms of the rapidity and reach of ideas and products, it becomes a challenge to decide how to steer and navigate through this environment. So long as you navigate yourself ethically and are making a definite contribution to the  larger good, you are fine.

Well, so those are the thoughts with which I start. Now let's AMA away!


**[Volunteer's note: Prof. Yajnik will start answering questions at around 9.30 pm. Feel free to post your questions till then]**

This AMA is on behalf of my grandfather. A few days ago [I posted](http://imgur.com/a/rQ210) pictures of his pre-Independence British Passport that was issued to him when he had to travel to the Middle East in early 1947. The post generated a lot of interest and people had questions for him and requested an AMA.

I've frequently talked to him about his experiences and he has told me bits and pieces over the years. It's really fascinating to listen to because it was a completely-different time, and it's amazing listening to someone who actually lived through those times.

My grandfather is 93 years old. He went to UC College in Aluva, but didn't finish his degree, instead deciding to run away and join the military. He took a train from Chennai to Lahore for basic training, and then went to Bombay for a Wireless Operators Course. After that he spent a few months in Hyderabad where he was promoted to Sergeant. 

He was then posted to Ramree Island off the coast of Burma with the 4th squadron of the Royal Indian Air force to help them conduct recce operations against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the end of the war he was offered a chance to be part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, but instead opted to leave the military.

He worked for Kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the Iraq Petroleum Company, which he took. This was when he was issued his passport.

In the last 9 years in Parliament, I have taken up issues that range from the welfare of our Veterans and Armed forces, the Economy, Crony capitalists, push for Governance reforms, and also issues like the 2G and other scams.


I have a passion for all things Technology including internet and technology policy, and firmly believe that technology can transform Indian Politics and Governance, our democracy and lives of all citizens. I believe that an enabling internet policy ecosystem, including a neutral internet, is crucial to the success of Digital India.


I have worked as a Chip designer at Intel and worked on the 80486 and Pentium chips, Set up one of the first and largest Greenfield Indian cellular service BPL mobile, and then transitioned into being a technology entrepreneur. As an MP, I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down earlier this year.


I believe that the current debate on Net Neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous Governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on Internet Governance  model based structure for Internet Governance. For over three years now, I have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for Internet Governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of Net neutrality.

1635,"Hi /r/India, I’m Shankar. I’m an out Indian gay man living in Chennai. Ask me anything!",218,2b7pz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2b7pz6/hi_rindia_im_shankar_im_an_out_indian_gay_man/,322,1405898469.0,"I’m Shankar and I’m 22 years old. I came out publicly on Facebook in December 2013, a couple of weeks after the Supreme Court verdict reinstating Section 377. I graduated in June 2013, and I was out to about twenty friends in college even before I posted on Facebook. I told my Dad when I was in third year of college, and my sister, a few months before I came out on Facebook. 

Life has been a roller-coaster ride so far: it wouldn’t be an understatement to say I felt suicidal multiple times a week when I was in college (not because I couldn’t accept I was gay - I had always known, but because of a couple of other experiences that are a direct result of being gay), but since coming out publicly, I’ve managed to be a lot more happier and confident. I feel much less stressful than I used to, and I cannot even imagine how I managed to be in the closet for that long. 

I lived for 18 years in Tuticorin (a small coastal town south of Tamil Nadu). Before joining work at a tech startup in Chennai, I did my engineering in another Tier 2 town. 

If it matters: almost all of my best friends are straight. I’ve never been harshly discriminated against (no one has come up to me and told me I suck because I'm gay) but I’ve mostly felt like an outsider in college and school, and even today, I sometimes do (despite the fact that it might seem like I’m having it lucky).

A couple of links that can help you get a better idea of my life so far:

[My about.me profile](http://www.about.me/shankarganesh)

[My coming out post](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/coming-out-6f6a6c2f1139) (I deleted this from Facebook because I was depressed again a few months after coming out - I had a copy in my email thankfully, which I later posted to Medium) 

I’ve also written about life as a [gay teenager in India](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/being-a-gay-teenager-in-india-91e8ea58463), and [how I dealt with my depression and suicidal thoughts](http://orinam.net/dealt-depression-suicidal-thoughts/). 

The first step to equality is visibility. Talking about sexual orientation and gender identity is step #0 to securing gay rights. And that isn’t happening in India like in the US. There aren’t many out people, there aren’t many out celebrities (not that they have an obligation to come out), so I’m doing my tiny bit by being open about these topics today here. I’ll be here for an hour so feel free to shoot your questions!

**EDIT 1: I'll be around till midnight. Ask away!**

**EDIT 2: Loving the questions. Staying longer.**

**EDIT 3: I'm done. Thanks, everyone!**

If you're gay, bisexual or trans, and if you're feeling lonely or alienated or suicidal, remember: we're around. The only reason I did this AMA is for you. There are resources, you just need to look for them. Here's a start: [It Gets Better](http://www.itgetsbetter.org). And [Orinam](http://www.orinam.net).

As stated previously, we would like to talk about the process involved and the tools which are used to learn languages. We'll try to go into specifics if the language in question is one which we have studied before or studying at the moment. If you want to address a question specifically to one of us, do consider tagging our usernames /u/Taazaplaza or /u/govigov03.

Keep the questions coming in and we'll try our best to make sure that we answer each and every question. Here are our proofs and bios:

> **Bio of /u/TaazaPlaza:**

> I graduated last year and am currently preparing for masters admissions. I grew up speaking Saurashtra at home and English elsewhere, and in addition I can speak conversational Tamil and functional Hindi. I wrote an A2 in Spanish last year and I've been studying Chinese for the past 7 or so months. I'm planning to write my HSK3 this October and B1 in Spanish next year, and I've started Cantonese recently. I also have dabbled in a few other languages for fun and have a very amateur interest in linguistics. I've been on Reddit for over a year now and it would be nice to answer questions on language learning.

> I am currently doing my PhD in a specific field of Chemistry. I have two native languages: Kannada and Tamil. I started learning French by myself in 2011. I cleared my DELF B2 exam in 2015. I've also been learning German and Spanish from 2013. Looking forward to write the Goethe Institute German exam ""Goethe-Zertifikat B1 Prüfung"". I've started learning Mandarin for the past six months. I've been an /r/India user for the past 2 years.

I am Vahishta. In Dec 2012 I quit my job and sold my house and began planning the rest of my life as a traveler. I spent six months of 2013 in the US, backpacking from the East coast to the West coast. I saw some crazy shit, in terms of mind-bendingly beautiful landscapes, amazing cities and incredible people. And the food. Oh good lord, the food. You may have heard of me via my [blog](http://www.vahishta.com), or my [column in Mumbai Mirror](http://www.mumbaimirror.com/others/leisure/The-first-step/articleshow/20612506.cms) (which, I believe is also syndicated elsewhere in India.)

Ask me anything! Some common questions are: how I financed this adventure, what I do now, what my plans are next, stupid / mad stuff I did / saw...

I'm going to Europe next, for around three months (hopefully! Fingers crossed! Visas are always iffy!) so you can ask me about that too! 

Proof that this is really me: http://imgur.com/jo7pwFX 

BTW this brings up an important question: I'm not sure how to prove I went where I did - I have pictures of the places I went to, but I'm not in most of them. Just take my word for it, ok? :)

If you want more food for discussion, here are some pictures I took while traveling: http://imgur.com/a/axmsJ

PS: Yes, I know the time says 2.30 PM on the stickied frontpage post, but I was excited (and also I read the email from the mod who invited me to do this wrong, so here I am. Dealwithit.jpg)

PPS: How to make me incredibly happy: Ask lots of questions, be inspired, go traveling yourself, meet me on the road for a beer somewhere!

You can subscribe by typing your email address into the form on the right hand side of my blog. It says 'Subscribe', so you know what to look for!)
